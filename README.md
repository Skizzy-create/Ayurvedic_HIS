## üßê Problem Statement <a name="problem_statement"></a>

A software that suggests drugs and formulations for a disease/pharmacological property based on the Ayurvedic classical books/Repositories.

## üßê Description

A software that suggests drugs and formulations for a disease/pharmacological property based on the Ayurvedic classical books/Repositories. Ayurveda has a large database of single herbs, minerals, and formulations that have been tailormade to suit each individual, his/her psychosomatic constitution, clinical condition, comorbidities, age, region, etc. These data are spread over more than 150 texts, amidst Organization Ministry of AYUSH.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name="idea"></a>

Our team has developed an application that leverages state-of-the-art technologies such as GPT and Bigram models. This application is designed to interact with users and provide accurate responses based on their symptoms. It also offers precautions for the suggested remedies.

The application provides the following information:

- **How the medication will help**: This section explains how the suggested medication will aid in healing the user's symptoms.

- **Herbs**: This section provides a list of herbs included in the suggested medication.

- **How to make the medicine at home**: This section offers instructions on how to prepare the medicine at home with precise measurements.

- **Precautions**: This section lists any precautions the user should be aware of while taking the medication.

- **Tips**: This section provides additional tips for managing the illness or enhancing the effectiveness of the medication.
