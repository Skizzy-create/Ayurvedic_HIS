Foreword

Ragadirogan satatanusaktanasesakayaprasrtanasesan;
Autsukyamoharatidanjaghana yo'purvavaidyaya namo'astu tasmai.
It was really a pleasure to review and to write a few words as foreword on the press copy of the book
Astanga Hrdaya : Sutrasthana' authored by Dr. R. Vidyanath. The book comprises of the text and the
translation with detailed comments and updated information on different aspects which are very useful
for the present generation of readership today. The efforts to add the botanical names and photographs
of many medicinal plants to provide useful lead to correlate the same with the classical Sanskrit names
are commendable. The designed diagrams of some surgical instruments and certain treatment
procedures are really interesting particularly in the context of the study of a Samhita Grantha. This
effort obviously adopts the message of Vagbhata himself who stated at the very outset of Astanga
Sahgraha, that this treatise is being created to make Ayurveda Sastra yuganurupa.
The language of the write-up and the overall presentation of the book is easy to go through for a maiden
reader. The entire approach appears critical and creative exercising adequate care to conserve the
originality of the book and its contemporary readability. I hope this new addition to the contemporary
Ayurvedic literature will benefit the students and teachers of Ayurveda in pursuing the subject in a
right perspective.
Astanga Hrdaya is an important classic text of great educational significance as it is prescribed as a text
book for graduate students in view of its easy accessibility and because it is a better organized text than
the Astanga Sahgraha.
The galaxy of Foundation texts of Ayurveda comprise of two sets of authentic texts fondly called 1.
Brhattrayl and 2. Laghutrayi. Brhattrayl texts are 1. Caraka Samhita, 2. Susruta Samhita and 3. The
Sarhhitas of Vagbhata (Saiigraha and Hrdaya). Most often the Astanga Hrdaya is counted among the
Brhattrayl, not so often the Astanga Sahgraha. However many scholars believe that Astanga Sahgraha
is the prime text of Vagbhata.
The Laghutrayi texts are 1. Madhava Nidana (900 AD), 2. Sarngadhara Samhita (1300 AD) and 3.
Bhavaprakasa (1600 AD). The historians consider the Brhattrayl texts, especially Caraka and Susruta,
as the pre-Christian texts while Laghutrayi are the medieval texts.
In Indian historical traditions there have been several scholars holding the name of Vagbhata. The
famous Ayurvedic texts Astanga Sahgraha and Astanga Hrdaya are also authored by the one or the
other Vagbhata. Vagbhata represents the golden age of the Indian history, i.e. Gupta period and hence
it gives a literary glimpse of the Ayurvedic tradition and cultural status of that period in India. There
has been a controversy where the author of Astanga Sahgraha and Astanga Hrdaya is the same
Vagbhata or they are two different persons. However, considering many facts, it is largely believed
that they were two different persons and the two treatises were written in two different periods of
history by two different authors.

(vi)

There are controversies about the period of Vagbhata. It seems the author of the Astahga Sangraha,
Vagbhata's time was somewhere between the period of Vatsyayana (500 AD) and Varahamihira (600
AD). Vatsyayana was an expert of Kamasastra while Varahamihira dealt with another branch of
knowledge viz. Jyotisa and Vagbhata was a physician, besides being an erudite poet. The Vagbhata's
classics are largely the collection and codification of facts discovered through the works of Agnivesa Caraka, and Susruta - Nagarjuna and their contemporaries, besides certain new ideas and facts to
update the knowledge which seems to be the theme of Vagbhata as is evident by his own statement in
the text:
Yuganurupasandarbho vibhagena karisyate. (Vagbhata Su. 1:20)
•Hcfd^lU-Md: WT: W&ciH-SgHWilg: I
Sarvatantranyatahprayah samhrtya'stangasangrahah;
Asthanavistaraksepah punaruktadivarjitah. (Vagbhata Su. 1:18)
It seems Astahga Hrdaya was compiled by another author later in order to make the subject more
concise and easy to handle. The author of Astahga Sangraha is believed to have greater impact of
Buddhism as is evident by author's own omissions to Buddha. The critical comparative study of the
two texts in terms of the impact of earlier classics like Caraka and Susruta, it is believed that Astahga
Sangraha has more Caraka's impact while Astahga Hrdaya carries an impact of Susruta. The style and
approach of the two texts becomes obvious if one compares the depth and girth of the two texts.
Astahga Sangraha has 150 chapters and Astahga Hrdaya has 120 chapters displayed in different
divisions as described in the following table which reflects the preferential inclusion and exclusion of
the subject matter and the size of the texts. It will be interesting to undertake a critical comparative
study of all the Sarhhitas in relation to the period of compilation and the reason of such differences.

Total

The Sangraha and the Hrdaya texts of Vagbhata written dominantly in prose and poetry respectively
representing a glimpse of the Sastrlya tendency of Vibhaga vs Samyoga, Vigraha vs Sangraha and

(vii)

Vistara vs Samksepa. Astanga Sangraha is the leading text of Sarigraha style which incorporates the
subject matter from different Tantras and reproduces the same in a summarized form with greater
clarity, while Astanga Hrdaya adopts different style. Further it is obvious that ancient classics like
Caraka and Susruta deliberated more on the fundamental and philosophic aspects of the subject while
the later texts diverted them from philosophy towards practical aspects.
The present volume under publication by Dr. R. Vidyanath presently limits itself to the Sutra Sthana of
Astanga Hrdaya which contains 30 chapters namely 1. Ayuskamlya, 2. Dinacarya, 3. Rtucarya, 4.

Sastra-vidhi, 27. Siravyadha-vidhi, 28. Salyaharana-vidhi, 29. Sastrakarma-vidhi, 30. Ksaraagnikarma-vidhi.
Each of these 30 chapters have been presented in this volume with original Sanskrit text followed by
descriptive interpretation and author's reader-friendly comments in a lucid style, not caring critically
about the mere literary translation. He follows an illustrated style of presentation taking help of a
number of photographs and diagrams for the purpose of comparative study in the present day
perspective especially about medicinal plants, blunt and sharp surgical instruments and certain
therapeutic procedures. However, the authenticity of these illustrations will have to be validated and
verified in subsequent editions of this book after inputs from the readers.
Summarily, this book is a student-friendly scholarly work of great value. This is an important addition
to the contemporary literature in Ayurveda. I have known the author of this book Dr. Vidyanath for
many years. He is an erudite scholar of Ayurveda and is an activist and an enthusiast in his field. I
congratulate the author for this good work and wish this publication a grand success.

PREFACE
During the ancient times, Acaryas of Ayurveda had written voluminous works on different
specialties, which were not tangible to mediocre students. So, the time demanded in writing
concise books, which cover the essentials of all the eight branches of Ayurveda.
Vagbhata was the first person who composed a treatise entitled Astanga Sangraha by bringing
together the relevant medical knowledge contained in Caraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita,
Harita Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Kasyapa Samhita etc.
The author himself says "By churning the great ocean of medical science, a great store of
nectar by name Astanga Sangraha was obtained. From that store of nectar, a short treatise
entitled Astanga Hrdaya was written for the benefit of mediocre students".
Acarya Vagbhata was the son of Simhagupta and the grand son of Vagbhata belongs to the
region of river Sindhu. His fore fathers were also great scholars of Ayurveda. He was the
disciple of Avalokita, the chief monk of Mahayana Buddhism. Basing on the internal and
external evidences the date of Vagbhata can be fixed between 4th and 5' century AD.
Astanga Hrdaya is one of the most celebrated and most often studied treatises on Indian
Medicine, after Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita. The work significantly begins with an
aphoristic preface "What follows is what was said by great sages, Atreya and others." This
work generally follows the general plan of Astanga Sangraha and divided into six sections, 120
chapters. The total number of verses is 7120 in the extant edition.
Sutra Sthana is the first section contains 30 chapters dealing with Basic principles of
Ayurveda, preventive measures, diet and dietetics, classification of diseases and methods of
treatments etc. Sarlra Sthana is the second section contains 6 chapters dealing with
embryology, anatomy, physiology, physical and psychological constitutions, auspicious and
inauspicious dreams and omens, signs of bad prognosis etc. Nidana Sthana is the third section
contains 16 chapters dealing with etiological factors, signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and
prognosis of important diseases etc. Cikitsa Sthana is the fourth section contains 22 chapters
dealing with the line of treatment of various diseases including pathyapathya. Kalpa-Siddhi
Sthana is the fifth section contains 6 chapters dealing with formulations and methods
pertaining to elimination therapy, management of complications, principles of pharmacy etc.
Uttara Tantra is the sixth section contains 40 chapters dealing with the remaining seven
branches of Ayurveda.
This work has as many as 37 commentaries, the largest number for any early medical classics.
It has been translated into many languages viz. Tibetan, Arabic, German etc. In the Tibetan
canon, Tangyur (8 AD) is included a translation of this work along with Caraka Samhita and

(ix)

Susruta Samhita. It was also translated into Arabic about the same time under orders from
Baghdad Caliphs. Another translation was available into German, which was taken up by
Luise Hilgenburg & Wilibald Kirfel. The following is the list of commentaries available on
Astanga Hrdaya either fully or partially.
1. Sarvanga Sundara by Aruna Datta (1200 AD) was edited by Vijaya Ratna Sena Gupta,
Calcutta in the year 1888, and by Anna Moreswara Kunte, Bombay in the year 1889.
2. Ayurveda Rasayana by Hemadri (1271-1309) was edited by Hari Sastri Paradakara,
Nirnayasagar Press, Bombay in the year 1939.
3. Padartha Candrika by Candranandana (10th Cent. AD)
4. Hrdaya Bodhika by Sridasa Pandita (14lhCent. AD)
5. Nidana Cintamani by Todaramalla(14'h Cent.-15' AD)
6. Tattwa Bodhaby Sivadasa Sena (15,hCent. AD)
7. VagbhataMandana by BhattaNarahari (15th Cent. AD)
There is a compilation of drugs mentioned in this work, giving also synonyms, Astanga
Nighantu of uncertain date. It contains a Telugu gloss. Another compilation of technical terms
used in this work is Astanga Hrdaya Kosa by Valapad K.M. Vaidya (1936).

Only Sutra Sthana of Astanga Hrdaya was prescribed by CCIM as a one of the subjects in the
curriculum of BAMS course in the first profession. As on today sufficient number of Hindi as
well as Regional language translations are available in the market. As a teacher of the
concerned subject for the past decade, I have identified the necessity of proper study material
in English language to cater the needs of freshly joined students of Ayurveda. Keeping this in
view I have made an attempt to incorporate the translation of the text along with the related
matter compiled from various resources in the form of notes. For a better comprehension, the
book is supplemented with full of illustrations. In the annexure the following material is
incorporated.
1. Important Essay & Short Questions
2. Important Slokas to be learnt by heart
3. Table of Weights and Measures
4. Glimpse of Astanga Hrdaya
5. Alphabetical Index of the Herbs mentioned in the book
6. Glossary of Sanskrit Terms

(xi)

It may not be an exaggeration if I quote that this is the first illustrated book on Ayurvedic
Samhitas. Though the present book is primarily written for undergraduate students of
Ayurveda, it is hoped that Teachers, P.G. Scholars and General Practitioners would also find it
useful as a reference book. Keeping the latest CCIM syllabus 2012 in view, Maulika Siddhanta
part has also been incorporated at the end.
At this juncture I am expressing the pure, warm, sweet and bright flarrie of gratefulness to my
mother Mrs. Rajyalakshmi and to my father Late Dr. R. Satyanarayanacharyulu. I record my
thanks to my life partner Mrs. Padma Vani and my beloved son Satya Teja for their unbounded
affection and encouragement. Without whose infinite inspiration and co-operation, I could not
have completed this work so smoothly within the stipulated time.
I am extremely grateful to my beloved Guide, revered Preceptor, Versatile Scholar, Dr. K.
Nishteswar, Professor & HOD Dravyaguna, IPGT & RA Gujarat Ayurveda University,
Jamnagar for his continuous support and encouragement in all my activities.
On this happiest occasion I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Prof. R.H. Singh, Ex.
Dean, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; Vice-chancellor, Rajasthan Ayurveda University,
Jodhpur, a Versatile Scholar and an experienced teacher of Kayacikitsa for his acceptance to
pen the foreword.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my teachers, students and friends Dr. K.V.
Ramana Raj, Dr. C.N. Murthy, Dr. Ch. Ramakrishna, Dr. D.A.P. Reddy, Dr. S. Venkat, Dr.
Sarvesh, Dr. B. Ramarao, Dr. P. Manohar, Dr. P. Gayatri Devi, Dr. N. Srilakshmi, Dr. D. Vijay
Ganeswara Reddy & Dr. K.J. Lavanya Lakshmi who helped me directly or indirectly for taking
up this project.
My special thanks are due to Dr. Mallu Prasad CCIM Member & President, A.P. Ayurvedic
Medical Officers' Association and Dr. G. Ramachandra Reddy, General Secretary, A.P.
Ayurvedic Medical Officers' Association for their constant encouragement and support in
every phase of my service activities.

Preamble:
Though there are a number of treatises available in the Ayurvedic literature, the popular texts
are known as Caraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita and Astahga Hrdaya/Astanga Sangraha and
these texts are much more familiar in the name of Brhattrayi. i.e. greater trio. Madhavanidana,
Sarngadhara Samhita and Bhavaprakasa became popular as Laghutrayh.z. lesser trio.
The texts mentioned in greater trio i.e. Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita are called as Akara
granthas. That means they are self-authentic where as Astahga Hrdaya can be called as
Prakarana grantha i. e., which has been written by quoting the references from other texts.
Out of all eight branches of Ayurveda, Maharsi Caraka has been given top priority to
Kayacikitsa i.e. general medicine, where as Maharsi Susruta discussed the surgical aspects in
detail in his text Susruta Samhita. Keeping this in view Acarya Vagbhata has given equal
importance to all the eight branches and written this present text entitled Astahga Hrdaya.
Though various authors have written many a number of commentaries at different periods on
Astahga Hrdaya Samhita, Arunadutta's 'Sarvangasundari' and Hemadri's 'Ayurveda
Rasayana' are the popular and available commentaries as on today.
The text Astahga Hrdaya consists 6 divisions and 120 chapters as under:
1. Sutra Sthana : 30 Chapters
2. Sarira Sthana : 6 Chapters
3. Nidana Sthana : 16 Chapters
4. Cikitsa Sthana : 22 Chapters
5. KalpaSthana : 6 Chapters
6. Uttara Tantra : 40 Chapters
120 Chapters
In the literature of Ayurveda, four persons were seen by name Vagbhata as under:
1. Vrddha Vagbhata
2. Madhya Vagbhata
3. Laghu Vagbhata
4. Rasa Vagbhata

: Author of Astahga Sangraha.
: Known through the commentary
'Ratnaprabha' ofNiscalakara.
: Author of Astahga Hrdaya.
: Author of Rasaratna Samuccaya.

Vagbhata's Geneological Tree
(Vamsa Vrksa)

Vrddha Vagbhata

Sitiiha Gupta

Laghu Vagbhata
By seeing the geneological tree of Vagbhata, it can be observed that the father of Vrddha
Vagbhata is Sirhha Gupta and the son of Vrddha Vagbhata is also Siiiiha Gupta which shows
the Indian tradition of naming the forefathers name to the grandsons.
Mangalacarana:
{MIlMJII^Wddl^MTljUylMehliiy^dH^tll^l

ill ll
In Indian tradition there is a strong belief that for successful completion of any work taken up
by them should be preceded by offering prayers to their beloved deity. Similarly Vagbhata also
after praying his favorite God only, started writing the text entitled, Astanga Hrdaya.
Acarya Vagbhata believed that God is the unique physician who is potential in eliminating all
sorts of psychosomatic disorders such as passion, greed, lust, jealousy, anxiety, delusion,
dissatisfaction, fever, diarrhoea etc. from this universe and bows his head to that supreme
power and prayed that the ongoing work should not get any obstacles.
Reasons for Writing the Text: Astanga Hrdaya
Due to the short span of life in the present era, it is not possible for the human beings to study
the various texts of Ayurvedic literature in detail. So, Vagbhata thought that the acuteness of
necessity of the summarized text book which caters the medical needs of the humanity. That
may be the reason to compile all the eight branches of Ayurveda from the Ayurvedic texts like
Caraka Saiiihita, Susruta Samhita etc. and arranged the subject matter in a systematic way and
presented the comprised, full-fledged Ayurvedic text named Astanga Hrdaya to the universe.
All the available texts of Ayurveda have been taken into consideration by Acarya Vagbhata
and compiled the essence of eight branches of Ayurveda and presented in the form of Astanga
Hrdaya, which is neither too abridged nor too elaborated.

Atha + atah means afterwards-after praying the God, Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter
named Ayuskamiyam (Quest for Long Life), thus said Atreya and other great sages.

Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1

Ayuskamiya means Ayuh kamebhyah hitah. This chapter is intended to those persons, who
desire to have a long life.
Both the words 'aum' and 'atha' did come out from the throat of the creator of universe, Lord
Brahma initially. So, there is a strong belief that these two words are auspicious. That may be
the reason to start the text, Astanga Hrdaya by Vagbhata with the word 'atha

Purpose of Ayurveda
According to Indian Pliilosophers' view human beings are superior to any other living beings and
there are certain aims and objectives for human beings, viz. dharma, artha, kama and moksa.
Dharma: Dharma is nothing but to determine the paths of life correctly and what ought to do
and what should not be done and also renunciate the deeds which are harmful to others.
Artha: Artha means money. Money is definitely essential for human life, but money is not the
only essential thing. Earn money, but not at the cost of others. Select the right path, to earn
money and one should not eager to earn.
Kama: Kama means desire. One should renunciate the unlawful desires and fulfil the
psychosomatic desires by selecting the right path only.
Moksa: The ultimate aim of the human beings is to attain moksa. He, who follows the
instructions of the Indian philosophers, will definitely attain liberation.

Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra-sthana

To achieve these four aims and objectives of human life, healthy and long life is essential.
Ayurveda teaches us how to lead a healthy, happy and long life. Hence the persons who desire
to achieve the goals of human life should have faith in the teachings of Ayurveda.

The Hindus believe the Science of Medicine to be of divine origin. According to this tradition
Brahma the creator of the universe having known the immortal and eternal science of
Ayurveda in full, taught it to Daksa Prajapati and Daksa taught to Aswins, the vedic Gods of
medicine who inturn taught to Indra.
All schools of Ayurveda agree with the divine geneology upto Indra, but give different
versions regarding the transmission of the science among the mortals.
When diseases began troubling the human beings and causing obstacles for the acquisition of
purusarthas (i.e. dharma, artha, kama and moksa) sages like Dhanvantari, Bharadwaja, Nimi,
Kasyapa and others went to Indra and prayed for the mankind to get relief from different
psychosomatic disorders. Then Indra pleased and taught Astanga (eight branches) Ayurveda
to the sages.
Astanga Ayurveda (Eight Branches of Ayurveda):

1. Kaya-cikitsa (General Medicine)
2. Bala-cikitsa/Kaumarabhrtya (Pediatrics)
3. Graha-cikitsa/Bhuta-vidya(Demonology)
4. Urdhvahga/Salakya-cikitsaiE. N. T. & Ophthalmology)
5. Salya-cikitsa (Surgery)
6. Damstra-cikitsa/Agada tantra (Toxicology)
7. Jara/Rasayana{Geriatrics)
8. VrsaA^ajikarana (Aphrodisiacs)
The management of diseases depends upon these eight branches i.e. Astanga Ayurveda.
The sages having learnt the science and exchanged views among them and taught to their
disciples like Agnivesa, Bhela, Jatukarna etc. They inturn wrote treatises and became popular
in their names like Agnivesa Samhita, Bhela Samhita etc.
In this way Ayurveda transmitted from the creator of the universe to the mortals.

Description of dosas:
eTT*J: fori chibgrfcT sliT) <{lHI: fWIWd: 116 II

Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1

7

Briefly saying, vata, pitta and kapha are the three dosas (functional units or biological forces)
which are existing in the body. These three dosas keeps the body in the healthy condition when
they are in the equilibrium state, and causes diseases in the vitiated state.
Notes:
These three dosas have been divided into 3 types as:
1. Vrddhi (increased state)
2. Ksaya (decreased state)
3. Samya (balanced or equilibrium state)
Both vrddhi and ksaya have been further classified as mild, moderate and severe:
1. Vrddhi
2.Vrddhitara
3 .Vrddhitama

: A/pa (mild)
: Madhya{moderate)
: Utkrsta( severe)

4.Ksina
5.Ksinatara
6 .Ksinatama

: Alpa (mild)
: Madhya(moderate)
: Utkrsta (severe)

Briefly saying there are three dosas only. That means on an elaboration, more than three must
be there.
Basing on the site and functions of these dosas, they have been further classified as:
Five types of vata : Prana, udana, vyana, samana and apana.
Five types of pitta : Pacaka, ranjaka, sadhaka, alocaka bhrajaka.
Five types of kapha : Kledaka, avalambaka, bodhaka, taipaka and slesaka.
This classification has been made only for the practical convenience. Some acaryas
categorised the rakta as the 4th dosa basing on the following reasons:
1. Sthana (site/place) : Yakrt, p//7?a (liver & spleen).
2. Laksana (qualities) : Padmalaktuka sannibham indragopa-pratikasam. (Color of
blood resembles lotus flower, lac and the insect indragopa).
3. Kriya (function)
: Supporting life and nourishing thebody.
4. Vikara (diseases)
: Visarpa, pliha.
5. Cikitsa(treatment) : Sira-vedhana (venesection).
By the above reasons blood may be grouped under dosas. But it is not correct because as per the
definition of dosa— 'rakta' is not vitiating any other dhatus, but itself is being vitiated by the
three dosas. So, rakta cannot be called as dosa. Hence the dosas existing in the body are three
only.
Site of vata, pitta and kapha:

The vitiation of any of the two dosas i.e. either vrddhi or ksaya can be called as samsarga and
the vitiation of all the 3 dosas can be termed as sannipata.
Notes:
Such combinations are 6 and 10 depending upon the decrease and increase of the dosas as
under.
Six types of samsargaja:
1. Increased one dosa and decreased the other one/balanced state.

Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1

2. One dosa in the balanced state and the other in the increased state.
3. Both the dosas are in the increased state.
4. Both are in the decreased state.

Description of dhatus and malas:
SJTWcr: I W

^EJIT-

After that sapta dhatus (seven tissues) and trim alas (three waste products) and their functions
have been discussed as under.
Seven tissues of the body:
1. Rasa dhatu (plasma)
2. Rakta dhatu (blood)
3. Mamsa dhatu (muscle tissue)
4. Medo dhatu (fatty tissue)
5. Asthi dhatu (bony tissue)
6. Majja dhatu (bone marrow)
7. Sukra dhatu (semen, reproductive elements).
Three malas:

1. Rasa dhatu

2. Rakta dhatu

3. Mamsa dhatu

12

Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra-sthana

6. Majja dhatu

1. Mutra (urine)

2. Sakrt(faeces)

7. Sukra dhatu

3. Sveda (sweat).

Dhatus are so named because they support the body all through the life and they gets vitiated by
the three dosas and are called as dusyas.
Malas also gets vitiated by the three dosas, so that they are also included under the category of
dusyas.
Notes:
Functions of the seven tissues:
1. Rasa dhatu
: Prinana (satisfaction to the mind and nourishing)
2. Rakta dhatu
: • Jivana(supporting life)
3. Mamsa dhatu : Lepa (covering the body)
A.Medodhatu
: SneAa (lubrication/oleation)
5.Asthidhatu
: Dharana (supporting the body)
6. Majja dhatu
: Purana (filling the bone cavities)
7. Sukra dhatu
: Garbhotpadana (getting pregnancy).
These tissues are not only supporting the body but also serves as food to the succeeding tissues.
During the process of evolution of tissues, the ingested food is converted into rasa dhatu after
the completion of the process of digestion.

Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1

13

Then rasa dhatu divides into 3 parts as under:
• First part helps for the construction of the own tissue.
• Second part will be useful for the nourishment of the succeeding tissue i. e. blood.
• The third part becomes the waste product.
Similarly all the tissues are divided into 3 parts and the second part will be useful for the
nourishment of the succeeding tissues.
In this way the preceding tissues produces food for the succeeding ones.
Vrddhi and ksaya:
Tnn^:

r^H-O^ryyifit: I

Due to the ingestion of the food having similar qualities vrddhi (increase) will be taken place in
the body and ksaya (decrease) will be seen while taking the opposite qualities of food
substances.
Notes:
Both vrddhi (increase) and ksaya (decrease) are of 3 kinds according to dravya (substance),
guna (qualities) and karma (function).
1. Dra vya samanya : Intake of mutton increases the muscle tissue due to
the similar substances.
2. Guna samanya

: Sweet and heavy substances increases kapha dosa due to
the similar qualities.

3. Karma samanya : Exercise increases vata dosa by similar action.

Rasa:

4. Dravya visesa

: Intake of food prepared by wheat decreases muscle tissue.

5. Guna visesa

: Ksara (alkalines) decreases kapha dosa.

6. Karma visesa

: Excessive exercises leads kapha-ksaya.

Rasa is nothing but the taste which is being perceived by the tongue.
In Ayurveda 6 tastes have been described as under:
1. Madhura rasa (sweet)
4. Tikta rasa (bitter)
2. Amla rasa (sour)
5. Usana/Katu rasa (pungent)
3. Lavanarasa (salt)

Vata

Three types of dravyas:
ywn eb)iM Wfyfed £cAlfl|fr1faUT111 6II
The above-mentioned tastes are associated with the substances. Those substances are of 3
kinds viz.,
1. Samana dravyas : Alleviates dosas
2. Kopana dravyas : Vitiates dhatus
3. Swastha hita
: Which maintains the normalcy.
Eg. Drugs having sweet in taste, unctuous & heaviness in qualities reduces the vitiated vata due
to the opposite qualities.
Ghrta reduces pitta due to madhura rasa & other gunas.
Similary, honey reduces kapha due to the astringent taste and dryness.
The combination of milk and fish increases the dosas due to the incompability.
The food items, which are taking regularly i.e. barley, wheat, salihce, milk etc., are suitable for
the maintenance of the positive health.

Virva:
Virya means potency which exists in a substance. Basing on the dominancy of the qualities of a
substance 2 types of virya has been described as—1. usna virya (hot in potency), 2. sita virya
cold in potency).
Vipaka:

After the completion of the process of digestion, all the substances (either ausadha dravyas or
ahara dravyas) will be converted into one of the 3 tastes viz., sweet, sour or pungent. The
process of transformation is called as vipaka.
Madhura, lavana rasa dravyas will be converted into madhura vipaka.
Amla rasa dra vyas will be converted into amla vipaka.
Where as katu, tikta, kasaya rasa dravyas will be converted into katu vipaka, after the
completion of the digestion.
Guna:
In total 41 gunas (qualities) have been enumerated in Ayurveda as under:

Hetu (Causative factors for diseases):
<*)MI&h4uii

sOHfafcMlfrlHH*: I WU4iAjN[»J (c^ifl

9 II

The present verse represents an exposition of causative factors responsible for the production
of all most all diseases pertaining to the body and mind.
The 3-fold causes are:
• Insufficient utilisiation (hinayoga),
• Wrong utilisation (mithyayoga) and
• Excessive utilisation (atiyoga)
of time (kala), objects of the sense organs (indriyarthas) and the activities of the body, mind
and speech (karma).
Where as the proper utilisation (samyak yoga) of the above factors results in healthy state.
Notes:
Triskandhas:
Ayurveda is based on tri-skandhas viz.,
• Hetu skandha (causative factors/aetiology)
• Liriga skandha (signs and symptoms/symptomatology)
• Aushadha skandha (drugs/treatment/knowledge of therapeutics).
Hetu skandha:
1. Kala (time) : Parinama
2. Art ha
: Asatmyendriyartha samyoga
3. Karma
: Prajnaparadha.

Due to the above causative factors dosas gets vitiated and various signs and symptoms will be
formed as shown in linga skandha. By selecting the appropriate drugs from ausadha skandha,
which brings the vitiated dosas to the normalcy, is one of the aims and objectives of Ayurveda.
Kala (Time):

Karma (Activities of body, mind and speech):
Hinayoga: Not doing any activity or doing very little of it physically, mentally or vocally.
Mithyayoga: Doing unusual activities like suppression of natural urges, falling from great
height etc.
Atiyoga: Indulging in activities more than usual like excessive exercises, coitus, riding,
talking, thinking etc.
Disease-health:
Disease is nothing but the vitiation of the dosas and their equilibrium state can be termed as
health.
Classification of disease according to origin:
T: 112 Oil

According to the origin, diseases can be classified into 2 groups as under:
1. Nija rogas (endogenous)
2. Agantuja rogas (exogenous).
Nija rogas: In nija rogas, due to the irregular diet, dietetics and activities, dosas gets vitiated at
first and then signs and symptoms of the disease condition will be seen.
Agantuja roga: Where as in agantuja rogas due to abhighata (accident) signs and symptoms of
the disease will be seen first and then followed the vitiation of the dosas.
Receptacles of diseases:
elm cw^Mwlil^KfiiBHtifiifi^rr i
Both the body and the mind are the receptacles of the diseases.
112 1 ll

Sattva, rajas and tamas are the qualities of manas (mind) and can be called as mahagunas. Out
of the trigunas, sattva guna being good, is conductive to health, but rajas and tamas are
considered as the two dosas of the mind causes the psychological disorders.
/

Rogi-roga pariksa:
Patient is to be examined by the following methods:
1. Darsanapariksa (inspection),
2. Sparsanapariksa (palpitation),
3. Prasna pariksa( interrogation).

Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1

': 112 2 I I

And the diseases can be diagnosed with the help of Nidanapahcaka.
1. Nidana (causative factors)
2. Prag/Purva rupa (prodromal symptoms)
3. Laksana/Rupa (signs and symptoms)
4. Upasaya/Anupasaya (therapeutic test)
5. Samprapti (pathogenesis)
Types of desa and their relationship with dosas:

Here desa denotes two meanings viz.
1. Bhumi (region)
2. Deha (human body)
Jahgala desa, anupa and sadharana are of 3 types of regions.
In jahgala desa vata dosa is predominantly present and in anupa desa kapha dosa is
predominant. Whereas in sadharana desa normalcy of cfc>sa5will be seen.
Types of kala:
1124 II

Kala (time) is divided into two kinds:
1. Ksanadikala (moment, second, minute, hour, etc.)
2. Vyadhyavasthakala (6 stages of the disease i.e. satkriya kalas).
Types of therapies:
TTHJ^ yiHH

^HiHi^M^ifsyi i

Briefly saying the therapies are of 2 types as:
1. Sodhana (elimination therapy)
2. Samama (palliative measures)
Sodhana: Bringing normalcy of dosas by eliminating the vitiated dosas from the body with the
help of the five therapeutic procedures (Pahcakarmas) can be called as sodhana therapy.
Samana: To bring normalcy without eliminating the vitiated dosas and simply by adopting the
palliative measures can be termed as samana therapy.
Out of these two types of treatments sodhana therapy is superior to samana therapy. Because
dosas do at times gets aggravated by adopting palliative measures but there is no chance of
relapsation by treating the vitiated dosas with sodhana therapy.

The four limbs of treatment are:
1. Bhisak{the physician)
2. Dra vya (the drug)

3. Upasthata(the attendant)

Adhya (Wealthy): Patient must be wealthy. Then only he is
able to purchase the equipment and drugs required for the
treatment.
Bhisagvasya (Obedient to the physician): Patient must be
obedient and should follow the instructions of the physician.

Though the remaining limbs are equipped with all qualities, it is useless, if the physician is
inefficient. But if the physician is efficient, he can manage the treatment even though the other
limbs are not equipped with their full qualities.
Hence the physician occupies the most important position among the four limbs of treatment
by virtue of his knowledge, administrative position and by prescribing capacity.

DINACARYA ADHYAYA

[ Daily Regimen ]

3T?Mt f ^ r q f w f ^TIWPTFT: I ffr ? WlfUtWTt

I

After ' Ayuskamiya Adhyaya', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter named 1 Dinacarya
(Daily Regimen) thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
Maintain the positive health in the healthy individuals and treating the diseased persons are the
two main aims of Ayurveda. Keeping this in view Acarya Vagbhata emphasized the
importance of preventive aspect and allocated separate chapters like Dinacarya, Rtucarya etc.
Healthy person should have the equilibrium state of the three humors of the body, seven
tissues, three waste products and the power of digestion along with pleasant mind, soul and
sense organs.
Pratahkalotthana (Wakeup time):
In order to protect his life, healthy person should get up from the bed in
brahma muhurta.
Notes:
Basing on the above statement it is inferred that unhealthy or diseased
person need not wakeup early in the morning and has to follow the Brahma muhurta
instructions of the physician concerned. Brahma muhurta is the time, which is second half of
the last yama (3 hours) of the night or early hours of the dawn i.e. approximately at about 4.24
A.M.
Arunadatta in his 'Sarvarigasundari' commentary on Astanga Hrdaya it is clearly stated as—

That means brahma muhurta is the 14th muhurta kala of the night. One muhurta is equivalent to
48 minutes.
Whole night consists 15 muhurtas= 15 x 48 = 720 minutes.
Brahma muhurta is the time, which is after the completion of 13 muhurtas in the night time i.e.
13x48 = 624 minutes.
720-624 = 96 minutes.

Dinacarya Adhyaya : 2

27

Hence one has to getup from the bed early in the morning 96 minutes before sunrise i.e. at about
4.24 a.m.
It is the suitable time to study and obtain knowledge. It is also the time when all the three dosas
are in the equilibrium state.
Sauca vidhi (Cleansing):
: 111 II

After considering the condition of the body (such as food taken in the previous night has been
fully digested or not etc.), one has to attend for the natural urges and clean the parts well.
Notes:
* Healthy persons should eliminate the natural urges like faeces and urine etc. facing north in
the morning hours and south in the night.
* During defecation one should be silent, sit and cover the head with a cloth.
* Avoid forceful expulsion.
* Avoid defecating at dirty places, center of the road, heaps of ash, cowshed, burial ground,
sacred places, in front of women and respectable persons, facing sun and moon etc.
* But at times of fear and sick persons may void the excrements as they wish.
* At the time of urge, one should not attend any other work.
* Suppressing the natural urges leads vitiation of vata, which in turn causes many a number
of diseases.
Danta-dhavana (Cleaning the teeth):

Twigs useful for cleaning of the teeth:
* Arka (Calotropis procera)
* Nyagrodha (Ficus bengalensis)
* Khadira (Acacea catach u)
* Karanja (Pongamia pinnata)
* Kakubha (Terminalia arj'una) and other herbs such as—
* Karavlra(red) (Nerium indicum)
* Sarja (Vateria indica)
* Irimeda (Acacia farnesiana)
* Apamarga (Achyranthus aspera)
* Malatl{Jasminum grandiflorum)
Features of twigs useful for brushing:
Twigs useful for brushing should have—
* 12 inches of length with the circumference of a little finger.

28

Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra-sthana

* Should be straight and devoid of nodes.
* Collected from sacred places.
* And also having katu, tikta and kasaya rasas (i.e. pungent, bitter and astringent tastes) are
good for brushing.
How & when to brush?
* One should brush the teeth early in the morning as well as immediately after having food j
without causing pain or injury to the gums.

* Kala is divinity and it has neither a beginning nor an end. Time follows the accumulated
effect of actions of the past.
* Basing on the time only, the movement of the sun, the moon and other planets and also the
transformation of five basic elements take place.
* It is also the causative factor for the birth and the death of all the creatures.
c
Similarly, the increase and decrease of the seasons, tastes and potency of the substances,
strength of the dosas and the body depends upon the time only.

The months starting with magha, in combination of two, two succeeding months constitute the
6 seasons as sisira, vasanta, grisma, varsa, sarad and hemanta respectively.
Adana kala — the three of them commencing with sisira rtu (i.e. sisira, vasanta and grisma) are
characterised by the northern movement of the sun and is also called uttarayana or adana kala.

approaches, the cooling properties are weakened.
* During this period the sun with his severe hot rays and the winds with their sharp velocity
and dryness absorb the moisture from the earth.
* Due to the progressive dryness in the atmosphere during the seasons of sisira, vasanta and
grisma, which enhances tikta, kasaya and katu rasas respectively and results in the human
beings become weak. Therefore adana (agneya) is sweltering by nature.

The remaining three seasons commencing from varsa rtu (i.e. varsa, sarad and hemanta) are

kala.

* All the living beings gains strength during this period.
* Visarga is saumya. Moon is dominating in this period and the power of the sun is becoming
weak.
* Due to clouds, cold breeze and rain, the power of the sun reduces and moon occupies the
driving seat.
* Due to the power of moon with its cold rays unctuousness increases gradually in the nature
during the seasons of varsa, sarad and hemanta, which enhances am la, lavana and madhura
rasas respectively and results in the human beings become strong and potent.

After 'Rtucarya Adhyaya', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Roganutpadaniya'
(Prevention of Diseases), thus said Atreya and other great sages.
Preamble:
/

In the present chapter Vagbhata stressed that all the diseases will be manifested due to the
forceful expulsion and voluntary supression of the natural urges only.
Hence for the prevention of the diseases one should not suppress the natural urges like urine,
faeces, semen etc. and suppress the urges relating to rashness and evil deeds physically,
mentally and orally.
These urges are of 2 types:
a) Dharaniya vega (suppressable urges)
b i A dharaniya vega (non suppressable urges).
Dharaniya vegas (Suppressable urges):
1. Lobha (greed)
2. Soka (grief)
3. Bhaya (fear)
4. Krodha (anger)
5. Mana (vanity)
6. Mr/a/7a(shamelessness)
7. Irsya (jealousy)
8. A tiraga (too much of attachment)
9. Parusa vacana (extremely harshwords)
10. Anita vacana (lying)
11. Parapida (physical handling) etc.
These activities should be very carefully restrained mentally, orally and physically.

: Take 4 parts of water and boiled then reduced till 3 parts remained.
: Water boiled and reduced to l/3rd of the original quantity.
: Water boiled and reduced till the half of the quantity remained.
: Water boiled till the boiling point.

Water heated by immersing red-hot iron balls, gold, silver, mud or bitumen with water, or by
exposing to sunlight, either hot or cold, mitigates all the tridosas.
Such water is easily digestible and is ideal for samsarga and sannipataja rogas.
Boiled water lost the properties of dlpana and pacana and increases all the tridosas, when
stored for 2-3 days. Hence boiled water is to be prepared daily and should not be stored.
Hot water is also having the similar properties of cold water like sweet in taste and cold in
potency. Hence it is advisable to take hot water in thirst and fever.
In amajlrna and vistabdha-ajlrna also, hot water is advisable.

It is of 4 types:
1. Dhara (rain water)

3. Tausara (water from dew)

2. Ksara (hailstone)

4. Haima (snow water)

Out of the 4 types, rainwater is good because it is easily digestible.
Water from hailstones is very cold and heavy and increases vata and kapha dosas.

* Cleans and heals the wounds and unifies fractures.
* Increases vata and mitigates kapha.
* Consists astringent and sweet in taste, dry and becomes pungent after digestion.
Madhu sarkara:
By keeping the honey in a bottle for few months, sedimentation will be formed. Such
sedimentation is called madhu sarkara, which is having the similar qualities of honey.
* Honey should not be used after heating as the poisonous bees have collected it from various
flowers that are having different tastes, qualities and potencies.
* Hence the persons dominated by pitta constitution mixed with hot substances in summer
season and the area where the temperature is so high should not use the honey as it (is not
good for health) kills them quickly, similar to that of poison.

But the honey can be used after heating in the therapeutic procedures like emesis and
medicated enemata with decoctions as it comes out of the body quickly without undergoing
digestion.
Notes:
* As the honey is hard to digest, dry, hot and astringent in taste, it should be used in smaller
quantities. Higher doses leads to indigestion.
* Generally to treat indigestion hot substances and hot water are to be given. But this general
line of treatment is contrary to treat the indigestion, caused by excessive consumption of
honey. Because hot water and hot substances should not be given with honey and the cold
substances are unwholesome in indigestion.
* Honey being a combination of different tastes, qualities and potencies, is the best
yogavahi. Hence, when honey is used along with aphrodisiac drugs, it helps in the increase
of sexual vigor.

have been discussed. Among them rakta saliis superior and yavaka is inferior in their qualities.
Different types of pulses like green gram, black gram, red gram, horse gram and their
properties were discussed in simbi varga. Vagbhata stated that green gram is the best for
preparation of dala and red gram for external application, black gram is not good among the
pulses. Different types of food preparations like manda, peya, vilepi, yusa, mamsa rasa etc. and
their properties and indications were mentioned in krtanna varga. In mamsa varga 8 groups of
animals like mrga, viskira, pratuda, vilesaya, prasaha, mahamrgajalacara and matsya and also
their properties were discussed. In saka varga different types of leafy vegetables and other
vegetables used in daily life have been discussed. In phala varga, draksa (grapes), dadima
(pomegranate), plantain, dates, wood apple etc. have been discussed. Among them grapes are
the best and likuca is the worst. In the end Vagbhata described some of the drugs useful as
medicine in a separate group known as ousadha varga. Hence one must know the properties of
various substances individually and the combination of other substances to get the desired
effects.

ANNARAKSA ADHYAYA

[Protection of Food Substances]

^nWPTFT: I ffrT ?

I

After 'Annasvarupa Vijnaniyam,' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter entitled 'Annaraksa ' (Protection of Food Substances), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
In this chapter Vagbhata stressed the importance of protecting the food from poisoning and to
whom it is necessary to make the food become poisonous, how to test the poisonous food, how
to protect the food from poisoning and the preparation of various antitoxic formulations etc.
have been discussed.
Usually wealthy persons, landlords and kings will have more enemies rather than friends. So,
there is every possibility of poisoning the food and other substances by the close associates of
the lords and others, to kill them and snatch the wealth.
Hence the lords should be cautious in this regard and appoint the royal physicians to look after
their health and wealth.
Appointment of pranacarya (Royal physician):
{Ml <M"H,lglU?l SJIUIMlif Myiilcf Iflcfcd'H^drilci
yftMHjfel: (11 ||
The king should arrange the residence for the royal physician very nearer to his palace so that
he will be watchful in each and every aspect round the clock.
Duties and responsibilities of pranacarya:

I-qTTTSrtfr r^l-Drf)OTflTT"Stf^RHT:112 II
The foods and drinks taken by the kings should be carefully protected by the royal physicians
from poisoning, because the security of the people, and attaining the four pursuits of life
depends upon the healthiness and happiness of the lord.
Notes:
The author of Astahga Sangraha has delineated the qualities of royal physician as under:
Qualities of pranacarya (Royal physician):
* Royal physicians should have good family background.
* Should be affectionate and friendly.
* Having faith in God, soft in nature and should have good conduct and character.
* Should be skillful.

The food substances which dislodge the vitiated dosas from their places and unable to expel
them out of the body and acts as antagonistic to the tissues are known as viruddhahara.
Notes:
Such drugs and diets are unwholesome for the normal tissue elements, which opposes in proper
growth of the tissues; some act due to their mutually contradictory qualities; some by
combination; some by the method of preparation; some by virtue of place, time and dose; some
drugs by their inherent nature.
1. Milk and horse gram taken together becomes incompatible due to the cold and hot in
potency respectively. This is an example for mutually contradictory qualities.
2. Milk and jackfruit should not be taken together. Even though both are having sweet in taste,
cold in potency and becomes sweet at the end of digestion, the combination of these two
becomes unwholesome. This is an example of incompatible food having similar qualities.

146

3. Milk and fish should not be taken together. Milk is sweet in taste, cold in potency and
becomes sweet at the end of digestion where as fish also sweet in taste and becomes sweet at
the end of digestion but hot in potency. This is an example of incompatible food having
similar and dissimilar qualities.
4. Curds should not be taken after heating. Eg. for method of preparation.

Complications arise due to the consumption of incompatible foods should be treated in the
following ways.

In compatible foods do not cause harm to the persons doing regular exercises and taking
unctuous substances, having increased digestive power, middle aged and strong persons.
Similarly foods which have become accustomed and which are in lesser quantity are also not
harmful.
Notes:
The use of incompatible foods causes boils, oedema, toxicity, abscess, tumor, tuberculosis,
loss of vigor, strength, memory, intelligence, sense perceptions etc. and also asta-maharogas

One who desirous of long life should not have intercourse with a woman before the age of
sixteen years and above seventy years.
Before sixteen years of age, all the tissues will not fully developed. Hence they should not
perform intercourse otherwise dhatu ksaya takes place as the little quantity of the water in the
pond dries up quickly with the sunrays.
Similarly old persons above 70 years of age also should not copulate. If so, he collapses just as

After 'Annaraksa-vidhi Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'MatrasitIya' (Partaking
Proper Quantity of Food), thus aid Lord Atreya and other great sages.
MatrasitIya consists two words viz. matra + asita.
Matra means the quantity and asita represents the meaning for all the four types of food
substances i.e. khadya, lehya, peya andprasya.
Hence matrasita means the quantity of food is to be taken.
Quantity of food has been classified into two types namely pinda rupa and pratidravyapeksita.
As the quantity of food plays prominent role in the maintenance of positive health as well as the
production of several diseases, it has been allocated a separate chapter by name MatrasitIya.
Matra depends upon agni & drarya swabhava:

One should always consume proper quantity of food only why because consumption of
appropriate quantity of food increases the power of digestion.
Such quantity of food depends upon the nature of food substances, such as light and heavy.
If the digestive power is more, high quantity of the food also can be digested and when the
power of digestion decreases one cannot take more quantity of food. Similarly light articles of
the food and are by nature even if taken in excess they are less harmful. On the other hand heavy
foods are more harmful. Hence heavy food substances should be taken half of the capacity of
the individual and the light food substances also should not be taken to his full satiation.
In fact appropriate quantity of the food is that which is digested easily without causing any
trouble to the body.
Notes:
In Astanga Sahgraha Sutra Sthana 11th chapter, features of proper quantity of food is more
clearly delineated as under:

Features of excessive quantity of food:.
Intake of excessive quantity of food leads to the vitiation of all the tridosas at once and leads to
alasaka, visucika etc.
Clinical features of alasaka:

Consumption of excessive food causes the sudden vitiation of the tridosas at a time, and which
leads to the indigestion of the food material and produce diseases such as alasaka, by blocking
the movement of food. The same if discharged through oral and anal orifices (vomitting and
diarrhoea) is known as visucika.

Such indigested food moves neither upward nor downward direction, and stagnated in the

Due to the vitiation of dosas causes different kinds of discomforts in the body, especially the
pain resembles in pricking with needles all over the body and the undigested food material
comes out in the form of vomiting and diarrhoea in persons who are not having control while
eating. It is known as visucika.

Due to the excessive consumption of food by the persons who are weak, having poor digestive
capacity, vitiated by kapha and in the suppression of natural urges—leads further aggravation
of vata which obstructs the internal channels along with kapha causes all the above symptoms
except vomiting and diarrhoea.
Dandalasaka:

Due to the obstruction of the channels, the vitiated dosas are unable to move in the upward or
downward direction and begin to move in the side ward direction and makes the body stiff like
a stick and can be called dandalasaka, which is incurable and should be discarded for giving
treatment.
Ama visa:

Matrasitiva Adhyaya : 8

157

Due to the ingestion of unwholesome food, excessive food and also the food taken, before the
previous meals get digested, ama converts into amavisa. Whenever ama transformed into
Jma visa it will get all the 10 qualities of the poison (visa).
Hence it is difficult to manage amavisa due to the contradictory line of treatment for ama and
visa such as usna and sita cikitsa respectively.
Treatment for alasaka:

* Three types of apatarpana should be adopted appropriately in case of tridosas after careful
consideration of desa, kala, agnietc.
H^-HMMHH 112 1 II
TnTfTTTteR, d f e ^HI^dil^dlH,!
* Langhana is indicated when the dosas are in mild state.
* Lahghana-pacana (both fasting and digestive drugs) is indicated when the dosas gets
aggravated moderately.
* When dosas vitiate excessively, expulsion is the only way to root out them from their
origin.
Notes:
Types of apatarpana (Langhana):
Apatarpana (langhana) is of 3 types viz.
1. Langhana (fasting).
2. Lahghana-pacana (fasting & digestive drugs).
3. Dosavasecana (elimination).
(a) Langhana (Fasting):
••sratwrach
Langhana is indicated when the dosas are mild, just as the little amount of water in a tank
absorbed by the wind and sun, the mild vitiated dosas also comes to normal with the help of
fasting, which increases the power of digestion as well as samana vata in the body.
(b) Lahghana-pacana (Fasting & digestive drugs):
<=lldldMI,G}i17ig^l<C*<ulRc| xiHfdHSH^RrldKAl: I
Both fasting and digestive drugs are indicated when the dosas gets aggravated moderately.
To dry up the tank which contains medium quantity of water some dust and sand also required
along with the above factors like wind and sun. Similarly both fasting and digestive drugs are
essential to manage moderately vitiated dosas.
(c) Dosavasecana (Elimination therapy):
When dosas are high, expulsion is the only way, just as the crops in a field don't grow well,
unless the excessive water drained out.

Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In this chapter Matrasitlya, Acarya Vagbhata explained the definition of proper quantity of
food and their features. Qualities of light and heavy food substances, types of improper
quantity of food, inadequate, excessive quantity; their complications and treatment were
discussed. Amadosa, treatment, etc., food taken in proper quantity helps in bringing about the
strength, complexion, happiness and longevity whereas the improper food leads all sorts of
tridosas in the human beings. Three types of food to be discarded viz. samasana, adhyasana,
visamasana. Rules and regulations of taking food, postprandial drinks—advantages and cotraindications and at the end recommended time to eat etc. have been discussed.

After 'MatrasitIya Adhyaya' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter ' Dra vyadi- vijnaniya'
(Knowledge of Rasa Pancaka), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
Basic concepts of the drug were not touched so far. Hence a separate chapter has been allocated
to discuss the basics such as rasa, guna, virya, vipaka and prabhava as under.
Importance, nature and origin of dravya:
^Ts^f^rrerrsTEnr: cmr^dirM* dTj^rnrfijBiii

in n

* Dravya (substance) is the chief component among rasa, guna, virya, vipaka etc. as it is
providing shelter to the latter.
* All the substances in the universe are composed with pahca mahabhutas. Prthivl is its
subtratum and ap (udaka) or water is its origin, akasa, vayu and tejas are its other
supporting parts.
* The inseparable concomitance of prthivl and the other basic elements causes the origin of
the substances as well as peculiarity among them. In the formation of shape-aMsa
mahabhuta; for causing hardness- vayu mahabhuta; germinating parts of the plants-teja
mahabhuta; origin of the drugs-ap mahabhuta; substratum-prtAivi mahabhuta etc. plays
the prominent role.
* In this way the inseparable combination of all these 5 basic elements are responsible for the
formation of all the drugs as well as diet.
Rasa (Taste):

All the substances in the universe are composed with pahca mahabhutas and no substance is
formed with only one maha bhuta. Similarly diseases are also manifested due to the vitiation of
the tridosas.
Eg: Parthiva dravya means that the drug which is predominantly consisting of prthivl

167

Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9

mahabhuta along with the other four. Madhura rara dravya means the drug which is
predominantly sweet in taste along with the other five. Similarly vata jwara means the fever
caused due to the vitiation of vata predominantly and associated with the other two dosas.
Rasa and anurasa (Primary and secondary tastes):
In a substance rasa (primary/main taste) is clearly perceptible where as the anurasa (secondary
laste) is not perceptible due to the dominance of primary taste or slightly perceptible at the end.
Rasa has been described by having the qualities of the guru, laghu, sita, usna etc. But strictly
speaking these are the qualities of the basic elements, which are present in the substance. It is
only a categorical attribution and should not be taken as actual position. It is the quality of the
substance but not of rasas.
Parthiva dravya guna:
115II
* The drugs that are having the qualities of guru (heavy), sthula
(bulky), sthira (immobile) and also having the predominance of
gandhaguna (smell) can be called as parthiva dravyas.
* Those drugs are responsible for the weight, firmness, steadiness and
also the development of the body.

Prthivi

Jaliya (apya) dravya guna:
3TTXZT W^HfdWJ^cM^y^Kd-y^dl
* The drugs that are having the qualities of drava (liquid), sita (cold),
guru (heavy), snigdha (unctuous), manda (dull), sandra (thick) and
having the predominance of rasa guna (taste) can be called as jaliya
dravyas.
* These drugs will produce unct-uousness, secretions, moistness,
contentment and bindingness (holding together) in the body.

Jala

Agneya dravya guna:

* The substances that are having the qualities of ruksa (dry), tiksna
(sharp), usna (hot), visada (non slimy), suksma (minute) and also
having the predominance of rupa guna (vision) are known as agneya
dravyas.

Agni

* These are responsible for burning, brightness, complexion and color, digestion etc.

Vayaviya dravya guna:

* The drugs that are having the qualities of ruksa (dry), visada (non
slimy), laghu (light), and also having the predominance of sparsaguna
(touch) are known as vayavya dravyas.
* These drugs are responsible for dryness, lightness, non-sliminess,
weakness and division in the body.

* They are responsible for hollowness and lightness in the body.
AH the substances are medicines:

Akasa

111 0 II
Nothing exists in the world that is non-medicinal. That means all the substances available in
the universe are useful for treatment in either way.
Dominance of mahabhuta and the drug action:
* The drugs abounding with the qualities of agni and vayu have a tendency of upward
movement. This is because of the lightness and upward mobile nature of vayu and upward
flames of agni.
* The drugs abounding with the qualities of prthivi and ap on the other hand have a tendency
of downward movement because of the heaviness of prthivi and downward flow ofjala.

Thus ends the description of dravya. Detailed classification of rasas will be discussed in the
forthcoming chapter Rasa-bhediya Adhyaya.
Virya

According to some medical authorities virya has been classified into 8 types:
1. Guru (Heavy)
2. Snigdha (Unctuous)
3. Hima/Sita(Cold)
4. Mrdu (soft)

5. Laghu (Light)
6. Ruksa (Dry)

Hl4)4 cji^rl fchf^lrHcif 4)4<£dl fe^l I
Virya is nothing but the potency of the drugs. Maharsi Caraka opines that all these actions of
the drugs like elimination, mitigation etc are influenced by the potency of the drugs and
without having potency no drug will show its action.

VI=try^bffi)c|frfM I oi)e(gU|A| ^rdl^d^ilil^UIKftl 111 5 II
Reasons for giving the designation of virya to guru and other gunas:
* As guru and the other seven qualities (total eight) have been mentioned predominantly.
* As they have been attributed in many a number of drugs.
* As they were mentioned in Ayurveda prior to rasa and others.
* As they are potent in comparison with rasas and the rest of gunas.
3TW9'|e<M'0aroirH»-*Hcirt4lM AdTTT if^VIrl

4)4

&ld: 111 6 II

Rasa and other 12 qualities cannot consider as virya because they are having the opposite
reasons mentioned in the above text.
In this way eight types of potencies have been described by some acaryas.
Out of the twenty, the eight qualities mentioned here are only those, which are capable of over
coming the effects of rasa, and the other twelve are not contradicting the effects of rasa.
Hence the above eight types of qualities of the drugs only can be identified as the potency of the
drugs.
For e.g. the effect of the pungent taste in pippall could normally be the aggravation of pitta, but
by virtue of mrdu guna and sita virya, pippali alleviates rather than aggravates pitta.
The effect of bitter and astringent tastes in pancamula usually should aggravate vata, but due to
the hot in potency they are alleviating vata.
Two types of virya:

Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

Generally virya h of 2 types viz. (1) usna virya and (2) sita virya.
The qualities such as guru, laghu etc. and the seasons like debilitating and nourishing periods
are having the predominance of only two elements agni (hot) and soma (cold). So, virya is also
of 2 kinds—hot and cold, even though the substances are having many qualities in them, heat
and cold are more powerful than all others and the rest are within the scope of these two only.
* Usually the drugs containing katu, amla and lavana rasas are predominantly having usna
virya in their succeeding order.
* Similarly tikta, kasaya, madhura rasa dravyas are predominantly having sita virya in their
succeeding order.
* The potency of the drugs and diets can be ascertained while they are in association with the
body and are immediately after they come in contact with the body. For example hot
potency of meat of marshy animals is ascertained while it is under the process of digestion,
where as the sharpness of marica can be determined immediately after its contact with the
tongue.

* Usna virya drugs are responsible for dizziness, thirst, fatigue, sweating, burning, rapid
digestion and mitigation of vata and kapha in the body.
* Where as sita virya dravyas cause happiness, supporting life, obstruction/withhold and
purification of rakta and pitta.

transformed into madhura vipaka after getting digested. Amla rasa dravyas (sour substances)
will be transformed into amla vipaka while the drugs having katu, tikta and kasaya rasa
(pungent, bitter and astringent taste substances) will be transformed into katu vipaka.

Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9

Generally the effects of rasa and vipaka are similar to one another. That means the substances
having madhura, amla and katu vipaka will act according to the taste of those substances in
most of the cases.
Drug action depends on either rasa, guna, virya, vipaka or prabhava:
'|U||Ml"Ju| cfitfui

^Id fch^M

Some drugs will act by their tastes, some others by their qualities, some by their potency some
other by vipaka and still others by their special effect known as prabhava.
Powerful one only comes into action among rasa etc:
Utl<{lHi sMdT^H C)^ 112 3 I!

II24II

Among the different factors such as taste, quality, potency etc. whichever is more powerful
that makes the actions of others insignificant. In case of co-existence of opposing factors the
weaker one is overlooked by the stronger and comes into force.
Natural order of strength of rasa and others:
112 5II
When rasa, vipaka, virya and prabhavas are in equal strength, vipaka defeats rasa, vipaka and
rasa together defeated by virya, prabhava defeats all of them. This is the natural order of
strength.
* Eg. honey consists of madhura rasa and katu vipaka. Though madhura rasa is capable to
mitigate vata due to the dominance of katu vipaka it is increasing vata. Here the rasa is
dominated by vipaka.
* Even though the meat of buffalo is having madhura rasa and madhura vipaka they will be
dominated by usna virya and aggravates pitta.
* Similarly sura, a type of wine containing amla rasa, amla vipaka and usna virya, they were
dominated by prabhava and acts as a galactogogue.

Where there is similarity in two drugs in relation to their rasa, vipaka and virya but in spite of
this similarity these two drugs differ in their action. The distinctive feature responsible for their
distinctive effects not supported by their rasa, vipaka and virya is considered as prabhava or
specific action.
Eg. both citraka (Plumbago zeylanica) and danti (Balliospermum montanum) are katu rasa,
katu vipaka and usna virya. But, in spite of this similarity danti acts as a purgative while citraka

172

creates constipation. Similarly draksa and yastimadhu are having similar properties; draksa
acts as a laxative while yasticauses constipation.
Though ghee and milk are having madhura rasa, sita virya and madhura vipaka, ghee increases
the power of digestion whereas milk doesn't.
Vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya:

Till now the general mode of action of the drugs has been described. In addition there is a
special category of substances known as vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya.
Eg. even though both wheat and barley are having madhura rasa and guru guna, wheat
mitigates vata where as barley aggravates vata.
Though milk and fish are having madhura rasa and guru guna, their virya is differed with one
another as sita and usna respectively.
Similarly meat of lion and boar are also having madhura rasa and guru guna. Boar's meat will
be transformed into madhura vipaka at the end of the digestion, as it is samana pratyayarabdha
dravya. Whereas lion's meat is transformed into katu vipaka as it is vicitra pratyayarabdha
dravya.

After 'Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya 'Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'RasabhedIya'
(Different Types of Rasa and Their Combinations), thus said Lord Atreya and other sages. In
this chapter Vagbhata discussed the various types of rasas and their combinations.
Sweet, sour, salt, bitter, pungent and astringent is the six-fold combination of the taste and are
giving better nourishment to the body in their preceding order.
Rasa-utpatti (Formation of tastes):
— '""Tdlhi
Rasa or taste of the drugs and diet can be ascertained immediately / ^ • • f c j j j M P ^ ^ A
after their contact with the tongue.
faBL
.Rasa is the object of gustatory sense organ. Primarily apand prthivl
constitute the substratum for the manifestation of rasa and the other
three basic elements viz. akasa,vayu and tejas are only efficient
causes of the manifestation of the specific qualities of the taste.

^ ^ ^ . ( v C ^ / )

Rasa

The taste does not manifest itself while the water is in the atmosphere. As soon as it starts
falling on the ground it comes in contact with the atoms of five basic elements impelled by the
atmosphere itself and there comes the first stage of the manifestation of the rasa. The
culminating point of this manifestation is however reached when the water falls on the ground
and it comes in contact with the individuals of plant and animal kingdom. At this stage the six
tastes manifests themselves in the individuals. Different seasons also play an important role, in
the manifestation of tastes by the combination of the basic elements in different proportions.

Thus ends the tenth chapter entitled Rasabhediya Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana in
Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of
Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained the definition of rasa and the formation of six tastes
in a substance.
Then the features of different tastes, actions and the complications due to excessive use of such
substances and some of the substances pertaining to the group of all the six tastes have been
presented. At the end 63 combinations of the tastes have been enumerated.
Such combination and types are enunciated because they are useful in connection with
maintenance of health and cure of diseases.

Body is nothing but the combination of dosa, dhatu and malas. If these body constituents are in
the equilibrium, body will be in the healthy state.
Dosas when aggravated manifest their signs and symptoms in accordance with the degree of
aggravation, those in the state of diminution gave up their normal signs and symptoms and
those in a state of equilibrium operate properly. Hence it is very much essential to know the
features of dosa, dhatu and malas of normal, abnormal and below normal levels, so that the
drug and diet of different types, which have been already studied in the previous chapters, can
be utilized to maintain the equilibrium.
Specially to get the knowledge of normal and abnormal features of dosa, dhatu and malas, this
chapter has been explained.

* If the opposite qualities of dosa, dhatu and malas decreases in the body, it can be inferred
that those dosa, dhatu or malas are increased in the body.
* Similarly the opposite qualities of dosas etc. increases in the body, that means the
concerned dosas are decreased.
* For eg.—the opposite qualities of vata like unctuousness, heaviness and hotness decreases
in the body means vata is increased.
* Unctuousness, heaviness and hotness increased in the body infers that vata is decreased.
* Accumulation of waste products in the body indicates the increase of malas and the
excessive elimination suggests the decrease of malas.
U H l f ^ d r d l ^ H I S r a t ^ o j ^ i J U H : 112 5 11

Accumulation of malas in the body is natural. Their decrease causes harm to the body. Hence
decreased quantity of malas is more harmful than the accumulation.

There is a definite relationship between dosas and dhatus because all the substances in the
jniverse are formed by the five basic elements only.
Asrayi

Asraya

Vata
Pitta
Kapha

Asthi dhatu
Rakta and sveda
Rasa, mamsa, meda, majja, sukra and mala-mutra.

* Vata resides in asthi dhatu, pitta in rakta and sweda where as kapha resides in the rest of
dhatus. viz. rasa, mamsa, medas, majja, sukra, mala and mutra.
* The causative factors which are responsible for the increase and decrease of the asrayis
(dosas) also causes to increase and decrease of asrayas (dhatu and malas) respectively
except in the case of vata.
That means:
* The factors responsible for the increase of pitta, also increases rakta and sweda, and vice
versa.
* Similarly, the factors which increases kapha also increases rasa, mafhsa, meda, majja,
sukra, mala, mutra and vice versa.
* But the factors which increases vata, doesn't increase asthi dhatu, moreover it decreases.
* Similarly those factors increasing asthi causes diminishing of vata.
* Generally the increases of all dhatus are due to over nutrition and predominance of kapha.
* Nourishing therapy increases kapha and all other dhatus but reduces vata.
* Reducing therapy decreases all the dhatus and increases vata.
* Hence the diseases caused by increase or decrease of dhatus is to be treated with reducing
or nourishing therapies respectively except in vata.
* In all the cases the use of substances, qualities and actions either opposite or similar but not
antagonistic to the dhatus is to be planned appropriately.
Notes:
Causes for increase/decrease of the tissues and the treatment:
* The body tissues generally increases by the use of foods and activities which are similar or
possessing similar properties, they undergo decrease by the use of food and activities
which are opposite or possessing opposite properties.
* The dhatus which are heavy, undergo increase by the use of the substances having similar
properties of heaviness, similarly the dhatus which are light, undergo increase by the use of
light substances. By the use of opposite substances they undergo decrease.
* The substances, which are materially similar causes the increase rapidly.

• Rakta dhatu increases rapidly by the use of the blood.
• Mamsa dhatu increases rapidly by the use of ingestion of meat.
• Medo dhatu increases rapidly by the use of muscle fat.
• Asthi dhatu increases rapidly by the use of bones.
• Majja dhatu increases rapidly by the use of bone-marrow.
• Sukra dhatu increases rapidly by the use of semen or eggs.
* The substances possessing similar qualities may not present near by or not available (or)
though available may not be suitable to the individuals (or) being unwholesome (or)
causing aversion (or) tastelessness (or) due to any other reason it is the best to make use of
the substances possessing similar properties.
Eg.—in the condition of sukra dhatu-ksaya , the use of milk, ghee and other substances
possessing sweet in taste, unctuousness and cold in potency are indicated.

Reason for the increase or decrease of body tissues:
fel^M^HI

mffsfarTT: I^Mi MlcUfrljlfa'STf U l ^ ^ - M l ^ : II34II

Dhatwagni is nothing but the part or share of jatharagni (digestive power), which is present in
side of all the sapta dhatus. This is also another factor responsible for the increase or decrease
of bodily tissues due to the debility and intensity of the dhatwagni respecti vel y.
Though the forest fire (davagni) is continuously burning, gets flared up greatly at certain times
and decreased at other times, depending upon the nature of the fuel available. So also the
transformation of tissues undergoes increase or decrease depending upon nature of food
substances.
Substances, which are similar or dissimilar to the dhatus, are the causes for their increase or
decrease respectively because each one has its own specific action in quickly transforming
them.

Dosas gets vitiated due to the irregular diet and activities. Afterwards they vitiate the dusyas
and they in turn vitiate malas. Such vitiated malas further vitiates the malayana (anus, urethral
passage, mouth, ears, eyes and nostrils) and causes diseases.
Ojas

Ojas is the essence of the cream of seven tissues of the body. It is the first essential element of
the embryo and gets localized in its heart earlier to the formation of the different parts of the
foetus.
Features:
Ojas is soft, pure and slightly reddish yellow in cfolor.
Importance of ojas:

196

Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

* Ojas is the chief fluid material of the body.
* Life depends on ojas only.
* Loss of ojas leads to death.
* Main seat of ojas is the heart.
* Though it is residing in the heart, it is circulating all over the body and helps the activities of
life.

Causes for the decrease of ojas:
Anger, hungry, worry, grief, excessive physical exertion and others leads to the decrease of
ojas.
Signs and symptoms of diminution of ojas:
Fear complex, constant weakness, worry, affliction of sense organs, loss of complexion,
instability of mind, cheerlessness, dryness and emaciation.
Treatment:
* Milk with jlvaniyagana dravyas.
* Mutton juice (soup).
* Others, which confer strength.
Increase of ojas gives nourishment to the body, cheerfulness to the mind and strength to the

The person who dislikes such substances should be avoided and shows interest in such
substances should be made available. So that the diseases caused by the vitiation of various
dosas can be managed.
Reason for paying the interest and haterdness of substances:
Nl fanfldyUHAll: l ^ g t :

1143 II

If the dosas are in the increased state, the person wishes to take the substances, which are
having exactly opposite in nature of such dosas. Similarly if they are in decreased state, the
person wishes to take the food having the similar qualities to that of the diminished dosas. By
knowing the above fact it is easy to know the vitiation i.e. either increase or decrease of the
dosas, but the unintelligent persons are unable to recognize status of dosas.
Action of dosas according to their state:

Whenever the dosas increase they amplify their respective features depending upon their
strength. Similarly if they decrease, their functions are also diminishing. If they are in the
balanced state they will attend their normal functions.
Keep dosas under control:

The same dosas whenever they are in the normal state causes for the proper growth and
development of the body. But whenever they are in the imbalanced state i.e. either increased or
decreased state causes the destruction of the body. Hence one should be cautious and protect
the dosas without undergoing any abnormal changes by adopting wholesome diet and deeds.

Thus ends the eleventh chapter entitled Dosadivijhamya Adhyaya of Sutra
Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In the chapter Dosadi Vijhanlyam Acarya Vagbhata expressed that dosa, dhatu and malas are
the constituents of the body and imbalanced state of those are responsible for the production of
various disorders. The basic principles of the treatment is to bring back the normal state of the
dosas either increased or decreased by applying samanya-visesa siddhanta. Hence it is very
much essential to know the normal functions and the features of the increased or decreased
state of dosa, dhatu and malas. After that dosa, dhatu and malas relationship (asrayasrayi
bhava) was discussed. At the end definition of ojas, features, importance, causes for
diminution and their signs & symptoms, and also the treatment was explained.

* Increase of the dosas in their own places is known as caya.
* In that condition, the persons gets aversion towards the diet and regimen which are
responsible for the increase of the dosas and develop the desire to have the opposite
qualities of those of diet and regimen.

occurrence of diseases.
Prasama (Normalcy):

Equilibrium state of dosas in their original places is known as prasama.
Notes:
* Just as the clouds are brought together at one place by the wind and made to rain, the
aggravated dosas produce diseases either in the whole part of the body, half of it, in any one
organ being brought there by the influence of vata.
* The vitiated dosas causes troubles to the body by producing various types of diseases.
Among them, 80 are produced by vata, 40 are due to pitta and 20 by the vitiation of kapha.

AO the diseases are manifested due to the vitiation of dosas only and such diseases are
imumerable. Major diseases are mentioned in the Nidana sthana. Minor diseases are named
« th the prefix of the name of the organ, which they affect. For eg. nakha bheda, sankha bheda,
_
bheda, antardaha etc. The diseases, which are not mentioned in the text also can be

In grisma rtu, generally all the drugs and diet are light and dry. As the vata also having the
similar qualities, vata undergoes caya (mild increase) only, but not prakopa (further
aggravation) merely because of the hotness of the season. The vata (samirana), which,
accumulates in grisma rtu, will be aggravated in varsa rtu due to its coldness and subsides
automatically in sarad rtu.
In varsa rtu, pitta undergoes only caya, because of the food substances that are used possess
amla vipika, but not prakopa mearly because of the coldness of the season. The pitta, which
accumulates in varsa rtu, will be aggravated in sarad rtu and subsides automatically in hemanta
rtu.
In sisira rtu, kapha undergoes only caya by the use of food substances, which are unctuous, cold
etc. that are similar to the dosa. Kapha becomes solidified by the effect of season and doesn't
undergo prakopa. Kapha become liquified in vasanta rtu and gets aggravated, and subsides
automatically in grisma rtu.

Vitiated dosas cause various types of innumerable diseases like jwara and others and is
responsible for making uneasiness in the body. It is not possible to describe all aspects of each
and every disease condition minutely and hence common factors responsible for the
production of diseases, their signs and symptoms and the general line of treatment is being
delineated.
Dosa-vaisamya is the chief cause for the manifestation of all diseases:

All the endogenous diseases occur invariably due to the vitiation of vata, pitta and kapha. As
the bird cannot transgress its own shadow even though flying throughout the day, just as all the
things of the universe cannot exist apart from the trigunas (sattwa, rajas and tamas), so also no
endogenous disease caused by the disturbance of the equilibrium of the dhatus can occur
without the vitiation of tridosas.

In total, there are only the three causative factors, which are responsible for the production of
the diseases, viz.
1. Asatmyendriyartha samyoga (Improper correlation of sense organs with their objects).
2. Prajhaparadha(Intellectual blemish).
3. Parinam a (Effects of time).

Till now the signs and symptoms of vitiated dosas have been enumerated. Physician must be
known all these things through various investigation techniques viz. darsana (inspection),

physician must observe the patient constantly.

These are the diseases caused due to non-observance of wholesome diet and regimen and
simultaneously adopting the unwholesome diet and regimen.
Hence the diseases caused by the vitiation of dosas are having the visible causative factors.
lb) Karmaj a vyadhi:
These are the diseases caused by the sinful acts of the previous life and are having exactly
opposite qualities of dosottha rogas and are having the invisible causative factors.
(c) Dosakarmaj a vyadhi:

* In the above diseases, dosottara vyadhi is caused due to vitiation of dosas only. Hence the
opposite qualities of drug, diet and regimen are to be adopted to manage such diseases.
* The diseases caused by providence (actions of past life) will be relieved only after the
effect of such actions, comes to an end, inspite of the use of opposites.
* Dosa karmaja vyadhis will be cured by the diminution of both the effects.

* Svatantra rogas are also known as anubandhya vyadhi, which are independent, and here
specific well defined signs and symptoms and also specific causative factors and the line of
treatment is available.
Diseases, which are secondary are of 2 kinds:
(a) Purogami (Manifested prior to the primary disease).
(b) Anugami (Manifested after the primary disease).
Purogami: It is also known as purvarupai.e. premonitory symptoms.
Anugami: It is called upadrava or complications. They generally subside with the cure of the
primary diseases.

* Kapha and vata combined together follow the regimen of vasanta rtu, as the vata is
possessing yoga vahiguna.
* In case of kapha and pitta combination the regimen is that of sarad rtu.
Procedure of treating dosas according to their stages:
* It is easy to treat that when dosas are in the state of caya.
* If the dosas reached the prakopa stage, the treatment for the increased dosa should not
interfere with the other dosas.
* All the dosas are vitiated simultaneously treat the particular dosa at first whichever is more
powerful without interfering with the others.
* If all are of equal strength treatment should be given for vata at first, then pitta and at last
kapha because that is the order of the strength.
Ideal treatment:
TRTt^T:

yiM^iTl ^chlH^IM 611

* An ideal treatment is that which doesn't produce any complications after treating the
vitiated dosas.
* It is not ideal, though it cures one disease and causes the increase of another dosa at the
same time.
Factors responsible for roaming dosas from kostha to sakha and sakha to kostha:

Due to exercises (excessive), acuteness of power of digestion, unwholesome regimen and the
pressure of vata, dosas gets aggravated and spread from the central part of the body to the
periphery.
Due to the further aggravation, increase in fluidity, suppuration, removal of obstruction of the
channels and reduced pressure of vata, the vitiated dosas leave the periphery and reach the
central part of the body.
There the dosas are waiting for the opportunity; if conditions (like place, time and strength) are
favorable again the dosas gets vitiated and cause many diseases.
Line of treatment for sthanika (local) and sthanagata (non local) dosas:
I

d^Hl^llf^nTTf^ II20II

* Vata is vitiated sometimes in the local area and other times in the area of kapha.
* If the dosas gets vitiated in their local areas, the line of treatment is general i.e. by giving
antidotes to that dosa.

Dvividhopakramaniya Adhyaya : 14

217

* If v ata gets aggravated in the place of kapha and the treatment will be given keeping in view
: the strength of the dosas.
* If the strength of the non-local dosa is more, treat it immediately. If the local dosa gets
much vitiated, treat the local dosa at first. If both of them are having same strength then also
treat the local dosa at first and treat the other, later.

Hence they should be examined carefully and treat them by observing the body strength
and power of digestion.
They should be treated by the administration of appropriate palliative drugs or bring back
them to kostha by easy methods and should be eliminated through the nearest route by
vuitable sodhana procedures.
Features of sama and nirama dosas:

Ama:
The first tissue of the body rasa dhatu, which was not formed properly due to the weakness of
the digestive fire and accumulating in the stomach in the abnormal state, is known as ama.
Some acaryas opine that ama gets formed from intimate mixing of vitiated dosas with one
another just as the poison is formed from mixing of different kinds of kodrava (Paspalum
scrobiculatum).

Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained the general line of treatment for tridosas,
i ndividually and also given the suggestion to manage the samsargaja and sannipataja dosas.
Acarya Vagbhata expressed that these dosas gets vitiated not only due to the irregular diet,
iietics etc. but also due to the variations of the seasons also. Hence the relationship between the
dosas and seasons has been mentioned. Next, definition of ama, features of sama and nirama
dosas and also the line of treatment for ama dosas are explained. Vitiated dosas and their
movement in the body, line of treatment, suitable time for sodhana therapy and time of

After 'Dosopakramanlya Adhyaya' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Dvividhopakramaniya ' (Two Kinds of Therapies), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
In the present chapter Acarya Vagbhata deals with the two types of treatment viz. nourishing
therapy and reduction therapy, their advantages, complications and the treatment also have
been discussed.
Two kinds of treatment:

cif H&llrl d^4jUl|cJ<l&rf) I

Two kinds of treatment have been mentioned namely santarpana (nourishing therapy) and
apatarpana (reduction therapy); brmhana and langhana are the synonmys for the above
therapeutic procedures respectively.
Brmhana: Whatever adds to the corpulence of the body is brmhanaox nourishing therapy.
Langhana: Whatever is capable to reduce the body is known as langhana or reducing therapy.
Dominancy of mahabhuta:
Generally the body gets nourished by the use of substances having the dominancy of prthivl
and ap mahabhutas, while it is reducing due to the substances having the agni, vayu and akasa
mahabhutas.
^eH ^ n i t * 1 !

^dni d^Rlttill^Qidii mfrlclrto I
Similarly snehana, ruksana, svedana and stambhana therapies are also showing their effects
due to the dominancy of the basic elements only.
Even though 6 types of treatments have been mentioned, all the six types can be incorporated in
the above-mentioned two kinds of treatments i.e. brmhana and langhana only.

225

Dvividhopakramaniya Adhyaya : 14

Notes:
Sadupakrama:
1. Brmhana (nourishing therapy), 2. langhana (reduction therapy), 3. snehana (oleation
:herapy), 4. svedana (sudation therapy), 5. stambhana (astringent therapy) and 6. ruksana
(drying therapy).
Snehana and stambhana can be included in brmhana therapy while svedana and ruksana comes
under langhana therapy, basing on the bhuta predominance and their similar actions.
The drugs having the qualities of heavy, cold, soft, unctuous, thick, bulky, slimy, sluggish,
stable and smooth will be known as nourishing drugs and which causes nourishment to the
body.
Types of langhana:
7fm4yiMH ^frlffJUTHsNftl d^-tH II4II
Langhana is of again 2 types— sodhana and samana.
Sodhana (Elimination therapy):
Sodhana which expels the vitiated dosas from the body and maintain the equilibrium state in
the body is known as sodhana therapy. It is of 5 types viz.
1. Niruha (medicated enemata with decoctions), 2. vamana (emesis), 3. kaya-vireka
(purgation), 4. siro-vireka (nasal administration) and 5. asravisruti (blood letting).
Samana (Palliative measures):
MI-cH c[lMH ^^oillijmMMtll+idl: I
Samana is that, which neither expels nor excites the dosas but mitigated the increased dosas
and maintains the normalcy of the dosas within the body. It is of 7 types.
1. Pacana (increased digestion), 2. dipana (carmination), 3. ksut(suppressing appetite), 4. trsna
(suppressing thirst), 5. vyayama (exercises), 7. atapa (exposing to the sun) and 6. maruta
(exposing to open air).
In Caraka Samhita, it is clearly stated that one who is having the knowledge pertaining to all the
6 types of therapies is only the real physician. That indicates the importance of sadupakramas.

228

Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

Notes:
Obesity and its causes:
Due to the excessive ingestion of heavy foods leads to indigestion and which in turn causes for
the production of ama.
Ama gets mixed with kapha at the tissue level and make them weak and causes increase of fatty
tissue.

Karsya is better than sthoulya and its reasons:

* Emaciation is better than obesity because there is no effective treatment for the obese.
* Neither nourishing nor reducing therapies are suitable to reduce excess fat, digestive
activities and vata.
Treatment for emaciation:

113 3 II
* Sweet and unctuous foods and other comforts cure emaciation easily.
* The use of opposite substances like tikta, katu and kasayarasa dravyas cures obesity.
* All the drinks, foods and drugs useful for nourishing therapy are advised for emaciated.
* Aphrodisiacs like asvagandha, vidari etc are good.

* No other substances will make the body stout except meat, that too the meat of carnivorous
animals.
Notes:
* Take equal parts of pippall, sugar candy, gingili oil, honey and ghee and add corn flour

Food substances, which are having guru guna along with non-nutritious ones, are ideal for the
management of obesity.
Ex. honey and jatiphala. As they are having ruksa and guru guna they will be useful in reducing
fat as well as takes time to digest.
Where as opposites are useful for emaciated.
Ya va and godhuma are good for both types of conditions.

In this way 33 groups of drugs have been enumerated for the management of various disease
conditions. If all the drugs mentioned in any one of the groups are not available due to the
season and ecological conditions, one can opt alternative drugs having similar therapeutic
properties.

Prescribing the above drugs in the form of kalka (paste), quatha (decoction), sneha (medicated
oil), lehya, pana (internal use), nasya (nasal administration), vasti (medicated enemata) after
assessing dosa, dusya etc. will be useful even in the management of krcchra-sadhya roga

Thus ends the fifteenth chapter entitled Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya
of Sutra Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In the present chapter initially the classification of the drugs according to the mode of their
action such as sodhana and samana was enumerated. Then it was classified according to the
action of several drugs which acts on a group of disease conditions and the nomenclature of the

Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya : 15

253

group was given by the drug mentioned at first such as vidaryadi gana, saribadi gana,
padmakadigana, guducyadigana etc.
For eg: guducyadi gana means the group is headed by guduci. By hearing the word guducyadi
gana, one must be in a poition to recollect the group of drugs such as guduci, padmaka, arista,
dhanyaka and rakta candana along with their actions viz pitta-kapha-hara, jwarahara, chardi,
trsna& dahaharaas well as increasing the power of digestion.
Hence it is much more beneficial for the practitioner while treating a patient.
In this way 33 groups of drugs have been enumerated by Vagbhata in this chapter.

SNEHA-VIDHI
ADHYAYA
[Oleation Therapy]

After ' Sodhanadigana Sangraha AdhyayaAcarya
Vagbhata expounded the chapter lSnehavidhi' (Oleation Therapy), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
The main intention of Ayurveda is to maintain the positive health in the healthy individuals as
well as to treat the diseased persons. To treat the diseased persons 3 kinds of therapeutic
procedures have been mentioned such as daivavyapasraya, yuktivyapasraya and sattvavajaya
(spiritual therapy, rational therapy and psychotherapy). Further rational therapy is subdivided
into 3 types viz. antahparimarjana, bahih-parimarjana and sastra-pranidhana (internal
purification, external cleansing and surgical therapy). Both the internal purification and
external cleansing can be incorporated into sadupakramas. For the sake of convenience in the
treatment all the six therapeutic procedures can be grouped into two only such as brmhana and
lahghana (nourishing therapy and reducing therapy), which were already discussed in the
previous chapter. Reducing therapy is again of 2 types:
(a) Sodhana (elimination therapy) and (b) Samana (palliative therapy).
Sodhana therapy:
Sodhana therapy means purificatory measures.
Maharsi Caraka has been classified them as under:
1. Vamana karma (emesis)
2. Virecana karma (purgation)
3. Asthapana vasti (medicated enemata with decoctions)
4. Anuvasana vasti (enemata with oils)
5. Nasya karma (nasal administration)
Where as in Susruta Samhita, rakta-moksana is added to the above by clubbing both types of
vasti treatments as one, so that the number five remains the same.
Before proceeding to the purificatory measures, pre-operative procedures like oleation and
sudation should be conducted to bring back the vitiated dosas from sakhas (periphery) to
kostha (central part of the body). Without conducting these preoperative techniques, the
vitiated dosas cannot reach the central part of the body.
Hence it is very much essential to conduct the pre-operative procedures prior to perform
Pahcakarma treatments.

255

Sneha-Vidhi Adhyaya : 16

Before starting the therapy, physician should procure the drugs in required quantity, which will
be useful for oleation therapy and also the antidotes, to manage the complications.
Qualities of oleating drugs:
yi^l, IcwAd f c l ^ u m j n II
Generally, drugs which are guru (heavy), sita (cold), sara (mobile), snigdha (unctuous), manda
(slow), suksma (subtle), mrdu (soft) and drava (liquid) are useful for oleation therapy and the
drugs having exactly opposite qualities like laghu (light), usna (hot), sthira (stable), ruksa
(dry), tiksna (sharp), sthula (bulky), kathina (hard) and sandra (solid) are useful for dryness of
the body.
Literally sneha means oleate or to make smooth. The process of producing unctuousness,
fluidity, softness and smoothness in the body is known as oleation.
Best oleating substances:

Vasa

Taila

Though there are a number of unctuous substances available in the nature sarpih (ghee), majja
(bone marrow), vasa (muscle fat) and taila (sesame oil) are the best among them.
Out of all unctuous substances, ghee is the best one, because it follows the properties of the
substances with which it is processed, as it is sweet in taste, not producing any burning
sensation and is taken since birth.
Sarpih, majja, vasa and taila are superior to one another in mitigating pitta in the preceding
order, and in their succeeding order they mitigate vata and kapha.
^dlrld

ciyi rldl-M^I ddlsft^T I

Ghrta, taila, vasa and majja are heavier to one another in their succeeding order that means
bone marrow is the heaviest among the four unctuous substances.
The combination of any of the two unctuous substances can be known as yamaka. If any of

256

Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

three substances combined together it is called trivrt and the combination of all the four
oleating substances are known as mahan.
These oleating substances will get from two different sources known as animals and plants—
(a) Animal source—curds, milk, muscle, bone. From which ghee, muscle fat and bone marrow
can be collected, (b) Plant source—fruits and stem yield oils.

Mode of administration of oleating substances:
: 111 411

Oleating substances should be administered internally after considering the dosage, season,
vitiated dosa and the body constitution as follows:
Vicarana (mixed with food substances), vasti (medicated enemata), nasya (nasal
administration), abhyahga (body massage), gandusa (mouth gargles), murdha taila (siroabhyahga, seka, picu and sirovasti), karnapurana (ear drops) and aksitarpana (satiating
therapies to the eye).

H^UJ chythlT^H: f^chtlfi^lSHT^I
* Administering the oleating substances internally by mixing them with other food
substances is known as vicarana. Internal administration of oleating substances without
adding any other substance is known as acchapeya.
* Sneha vicaranas are of 64 types in accordance with that number of combinations of rasas.
* Accha peya gives proper oleating signs and symptoms faster than vicaraniya . Hence the
former is superior to the later.
Dosage of oleating substances:
711

t j ^ A i H j n 8ii
* The quantity of oil digested in two yamas (six hours) is called hrasva matra. Madhayama
matra will be digested in four yamas (twelve hours) and the quantity, which, will be
digested in eight yamas (24 hours), is called uttama matra.
* Keeping the intensity of dosas, seasons, wholesomeness etc in mind, start the oleation
therapy, with the minimum dose or less than that is called hrasiyasi matra or test dose.
* Oil should not be administered internally without knowing the kostha. If so, at times the
life of the patient may be put into danger.
Notes:
Hrasva matra:
* It is indicated for the persons who are weak, having decreased digestive power, children,
aged, delicate persons, habituated to take unwholesome food, remains empty, suffering
with fever, diarrhoea, cough etc.
* It is ideal because it is easy to administer, as the quantity is less.
* It gives strength slowly.
* And is not creating any complications.

259

Sneha-Vidhi Adhyaya : 16

Madhayma matra:
* It is indicated for diabetes, urustambha, carbnucles, skin diseases gout etc. and the persons
having mrdu kostha.
* It will produce unctuousness in the body, without reducing the strength of the body.
* Though complications may arise, they are mild.
* It also helps to eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body.
Uttama matra:
* It is indicated for hectic personalities, having increased digestive power, strength, able to
withstand hunger, thirst and physical strain, tumors, reverse peristalasis, herpes, snake
bite, insanity, dysurea etc.
* It cures the diseases caused by all the three pathways of the diseases.
Classification of Sneha Dravyas
According to Their Mode of Action
Oleating substances are also can be classified into 3 types as under:
1. Sodhana sneha, 2. Samana sneha, 3. Brmhana sneha.

individuals choice after applying oil and contacting with fire, it is very much possible to bring
back the normalcy of the paralyzed parts of the human beings with the help of oleation and
sudation.

[Emesis & Purgation Therapies]

SJTR^riWT: I ffrT ?

Tl^T:

After 'Sweda-vidhi Adhyaya' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter ' Vamana- Virecanavidhi ' (Emesis and Purgation Therapies), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
Definition of vamana and virecana and the mode of action of emetic and purgative drugs have
Teen delineated by the author of Astanga Sahgraha in a lucid way as under.
Vamana and virecana:
^HHI-ts^HitmTPt

^T H^l^^^Hlf^l^Hrtir^-^lcl I

E \pulsion of vitiated dosas through mouth can be termed as emesis, and through rectum can be
called as purgation. In both the conditions as the vitiated dosas are expelling from the body, the
term 'virecana 'is suitable for both emesis and pur-gation.
Mode of action of the emetics and purgatives:

As the emetic drug contain usna, tlksna, suksma, vyavayiand vikaslgunas and also due to their
potency they will reach the region of the heart through the minute channels. Due to oleation and
-udation the vitiated dosas become liquefied and enter into minute channels. There the emetic
drug further liquefies the dosas due to usna guna and breaks into pieces because of tlksna and
vikasi gunas. From there the liquefied dosas reach the kostha without sticking to the channels
as the water runs through the walls of the earthenware which has been anointed with oil. Then
:he vitiated dosas will be expelled through mouth, because of the drugs having the dominancy
of agni and vayu bhutas, involvement of udana vata and also the upward movement of the
emetic drug. And the vitiated dosas will be expelled through rectum, because of the drugs
having the dominancy of prthivl and ap mahabhutas, involvement of apana vata and also the
downward movement of the purgative drug.
If :he drugs have both these qualities, they will be having emetic as well as purgati ve action.

chest and salivation one should try to vomit.
* Forceful expulsion should not be done. To encourage the urge, tickling the throat, with

(Note: 1 prastha = 16% ml.)
Vamana should be conducted till the appearance of pitta as well as getting proper signs and
symptoms of emesis.
Similarly virecana should be conducted till the appearance of kapha as well as getting
proper signs and symptoms of purgation.
• While counting the number of bouts in case of virecana, one has to start counting by
leaving the first 2-3 bouts.

Virecana-vidhi (Purgation therapy):

Purva karma (Preoperative procedure):
* In general purgation should not be conducted without emesis except in costive bowel.
Purgation therapy should be conducted only to the persons who have undergone oleation
and sudation, again after emesis.
* The day before purgation, the patient should be given mutton soup and the diet, which
should not stir up kapha. It should be warm, liquid, and unctuous added with sour fruit
juices such as pomegranate etc.
* On the day of purgation, after the completion of the process of digestion of the food taken in
the previous day, purgative drug is to be administered early in the morning, after passing
the period of predominance of kapha dosa, after determining the nature of kostha.
* Purgative drug should be administered in the empty stomach only.

* Whenever pitta is predominant, the nature of kostha will be known as mrdu kostha (soft
bowels) and even milk causes purgation.
* Similarly the nature of kostha will be assessed as krura kostha (hard or costive bowels)
when there is dominancy of vata and causes purgation with great difficulty even after the
administration of syama, snuhi, kahkustha and other drastic purgatives.
Pradhana karma:
* Purgation without emesis causes the obstruction of the purgative drug by vitiated kapha
and the drug may act adversely and also loose its power of elimination. Due to the forceful
action of the purgative drug, accumulated kapha reaches the left side of the abdomen,
duodenum and causes distention of abdomen or dysentery.
* These complications will not occur in the persons having costive bowel, because of the
predominance of vata.
* The complications observed in purgation without emesis are also found in case of
conducting purgation during the period of kapha predominance. Pain, distension of the
abdomen and heaviness are the symptoms observed.
* Hence purgative drug should be given only after passing the period of kapha dominancy.
Suitable purgative drug according to dosa:

* Purgation is to be conducted with the drugs, which are having kasaya and madhura rasa for
pitta diseases. Where as katu rasa drugs should be given in kapha disorders and snigdha,
usna and lavana rasa (unctuous, hot and salty) substances are indicated for vata disorders.

Vamana Virecana-Vidhi Adhyaya : 18

287

Notes:
Soon after the purgative drug has been given, cold water should be sprinkled on the face of
the patient to prevent the occurrence of vomiting.
Then asked the patient to gargle his mouth with warm water and inhale the smell of soil,
lemon, madiphala, jasmine etc.
' Afterwards the patient is asked to take rest in a room, which is devoid of heavy breeze, and
drink warm water at regular intervals to initiate the urges.
* Should not suppress the urges and evacuate the bowels in the bed pan to measure the
quantity of output.
' During the process of purgation, vata, urine, faeces, pitta, and kapha will be expelled in the
succeeding order and flatus, at the end.
Measures to be followed in the absence of bouts:
-3T5P£rfrgMI-M4)ttJI3 5ll
If the bouts are not started, the patient is asked to drink hot water to activate the drug and his
- iomen should be fomented with hands made warm.
Replication of purgative drug administration:

dlPlch ^UHMI^M W-McfafashHqj
* If the given drug doesn' t serve the purpose of eliminating the vitiated dosa, he is allowed to
take food on that day and sufficient dose of the purgative drug can be administered on the
next day.
* If the purgative drug is being digested without doing its function, second dose can be given
on the same day.
* Never administer second dose without knowing the position of the drug, which may cause
severe complications. If the purgation therapy may not be fulfilled successfully due to the
improper oleation and sudation, give rest for a period of 10 days and conduct the total
procedure systematically without repeating the previous mistakes.
Signs and symptoms of improper, proper and excessive purgation:

* Pinasa (coryza)
* Vata vidgraha (obstruction of flatus and faeces).
Proper signs and symptoms:

Exactly opposite of the above signs and symptoms can be treated as proper signs and
symptoms of purgation.
Signs and symptoms of excessive purgation:

* After the elimination of faeces, pitta, kapha and vata in the succeeding order liquid material
without associating any dosas will be eliminated from the body. Such liquid material may
be whitish or blackish in color or associated with blood or the color resembling red blood or
mamsadhavana tulya (resembling the water in which meat has been washed) or medo
khandabhameva (looks like a piece of fatty tissue) will be discharged.
* Guda nissarana (prolapsed rectum).
* Trsna(thirst).
* Bhrama (giddiness).
* Netrapravesana(sunkeneyes).
* And also the symptoms of excessive emesis.
Pascat karma (Post-operative care):

After obtaining proper signs and symptoms of purgation follow the post-operative regimen
similar to emesis except dhumapana. Afterwards follow samsarjana krama.

After the administration of virecana drug, the person is advised to go for lahghana (fasting) in
the following 5 conditions:
1. Manda vahni (loss of power of digestion).
2. Asamsuddha (improper signs of purification).
3. Aksama (not became emaciated due to sodhana therapy).
4. Dosa durbala (not become weak by the increase of dosa).
5. Adrsta jirna lihga (not appearing the symptoms of the digestion of the administered
purgative drug).

Vamana Virecana-Vidhi Adhyaya : 18

289

Conduction of fasting in the above conditions doesn't cause any sort of discomfort due the
?struction of dosas, which were aggravated by oleation and sudation.
Necessity of peyadi krama:
W f a d l ^ f a w i d ^ - M l ^ H r t f ^ : 1145 II

Soon after the elimination therapy, bloodletting, oleation etc. the digestive power gets
mpaired. Hence 'peyadi samsarjana krama 'is to be followed.
Ineligible for peyadi krama:
1146II

Peyadi samsarjana krama' should not be given in the following conditions:
• Oozing of little quantity of pitta and kapha, habituated alcoholic, vata-pitta constitution,
For those tarpanais indicated.
Commencement of drug action:
3ti|eW dm' ^iMI-^M-wUMH' [CAT5HH^I47II
Emetic drug will act without undergoing the process of digestion, where as purgative drug acts
only after undergoing the process of digestion. Hence the physician need not wait for digesting
the emetic drug.

Person, who is weak and in a condition of increased vitiation of dosas develop bouts of
purgation even without administering the purgative drug, In such circumstance he should be
treated with the foods having the property of bhedana (purgative).
Reasons for administration of mild drugs to the weak persons etc:
^sfct:7frftRr: qducy^ltr: cR?ft^T: 1149 II

* Administer the drug having mild potency as well as less in quantity in the following
conditions:
Durbala (weak persons), sodhita purvam (undergone purificatory measures previously),
alpadosa (mild vitiation of dosa), krsa (emaciated), aparijhata kostha (unknown bowels),
* It is better to administer lesser doses in frequent intervals. Otherwise it may be harmful and
cause even death.

290

Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

* The drug in smaller and repeated doses will be able to eliminate the vitiated dosas from the
body gradually and brings back the normalcy of dosas without causing any weakness in the
body.
* Dosas should be eliminated from the body of a weak person, when they are in the state of
mild vitiation only. Other-wise they trouble the person greatly and even kill him.
Procedure of elimination in case of mandagni and krura kostha:
tfrtchlB ^ n T f l K H c t t i ^ : 115 2 11

Those who are having weak digestive power and costive bowels (krura kostha) should be given
ghee processed with alkalies and salts prior to the administration of purificatory drugs to
restore the power of digestion as well as to conquer kapha and vata.
Administer vasti before purgation in case of ruksa and others:

115 5 II

* Purgative drug is being digested and eliminated from the body without performing it's
action in the following conditions:
Ruksa (who are dry), bahu anila (excessive vitiation of vata), krura kostha (costive
bowels), vyayamasili (doing regular exercises), diptagni(strong digestive power).
* In such circumstances conduct vasti karma initially followed by snigdha virecana with
eranda taila or bindu ghrta.
(or)
* Remove the obstructed faeces by means of phalavarti (rectal suppositories) and then
administer snigdha virecana dravya.
Administer purgative drug after mild oleation:

Persons who are suffering from visa (poison), abhighata (injury), pitika (boils), kustha (skin
disorders), sopha (swelling), visarpa (herpes), kamala (jaundice), pandu (anemia), meha
(diabetes) etc. should be administered purgative drug after mild oleation.
All the above should be given snigdha virecana and those who are unctuous should be given
ruksa virecana.
Conduct oleation and sudation in between purificatory measures:

Thus ends the eighteenth chapter entitled Vamana-virecana-vldhi Adhyaya
of Sutra Sthana in Astahga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained the eliminatory procedures such as emesis and
r -rgation in a systematic way. Definition of emesis and purgation, mode of action, indications
f those techniques according to dosas, eligible and not eligible persons for emesis and
purgation, pre-operative, operative and post-operative procedures of emesis and purgation,
<aihsaijana krama etc. have been discussed. In the end the importance of proper administration
f the purificatory drugs was mentioned.

* Hence the maximum quantity of anuvasana vasti dravya is 1/4' quantity of niruha vasti
dravyai.e. 3 prasrta or 300 ml.
Notes:
Anuvasana vasti:
Anuvasana vasti is the medicated enemata in which the four types of unctuous substances
mentioned in oleation therapy, is used after processing with the appropriate drugs and is
intended for producing lubrication.

297

(b) Anuvasana vasti

(c) Matra vasti

" 1/4 quantity of niruha vasti is sneha vasti i.e. 300 ml.; half of the quantity of sneha vasti is
anuvasana vasti i.e. 150 ml only. Half the quantity of anuvasana vasti is matra vasti i.e. 75
ml only.
' Matra vasti is one of the types of anuvasana vasti and its dose is equivalent to that of
minimum dose of oleation therapy. It is also be given regularly as that of madhutailika vasti
to the persons who are old, children, walking long distances, carrying heavy loads,
traveling by vehicles, doing regular exercises, undergoing excessive coitus etc.

The person who is to be treated with asthapana should have undergone oleation, sudation,
emesis and purgation therapies earlier and gained strength by following the regimen of specific
diet mentioned in samsarjana krama. He should be eligible
• r anuvasana vasti also. Hence anuvasana vasti is to be
given prior to asthapana vasti.
Anuvasana vasti should be given during day time in winter
_nd spring seasons; and during night time in other seasons,
•herwise complications may arise which were mentioned in
Meation therapy.
' Prior to start the therapy, procure vastinetra and
vastiputaka, which are not having any defects.
" Then prepare the vasti dravya in a required quantity according to age group.
' Afterwards gentle massage on the body is to be conducted with suitable oil followed by
mild fomentation.
• Then ask the patient to have light food, which is neither too unctuous nor too dry.
* Never administer the unctuous enemata in the empty stomach.
* Administered unctuous enemata in the empty stomach travels in the upward direction
quickly due to its mobile, far reaching and minuteness. And which cannot be useful to
control vata, simultaneously causing complications.
* If administered after taking food, it obstructs the flow of the given substance in the upward
direction and will stay in the large intestines, so that the expected results will get.

* Vasti is the best line of treatment for vata disorders. It causes instant relief, nourishment to
the body and also eliminates the vitiated vata dosas completely from the body.
* Vata is the leader among the dosika trio, independent, and is responsible for all the
physiological functions of the body.
* As it is of five types, it occupies all parts of the body, controls creation, sustenance and
destruction of all external and internal things and also causes for the production of diseases
in all the three pathways.
* Though emesis and purgation eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body, the drugs used in
those therapies are pungent, sharp and hot in potency, which cannot be taken easily by the
children and old persons. But vasti can be given in all age groups without any hesitation.
* Hence it is also advisable for children, old persons, emaciated, obese, tissue depletion,
weak sense organs, women, infertility or difficulty in labor due to the vitiation of vata. It is
also advisable to improve digestive power, color complexion, intelligence, voice, life span
and happiness.
* Vasti is useful to maintain the youth and also beneficial in diseases like lameness,
urustambha, fractures, contractures, distension of abdomen, colic, anorexia, reverse
peristalsis, cutting pain in the rectum etc.

Ascotananjana-Vidhi Adhyaya : 23

* Hence vasti is described as half of the treatment for almost all diseases and some others
opine that it is full treatment even.
Importance of siravedhana:
Similarly siravedhana also occupies unique position in the management of endogenous as well
as exogenous diseases born by the vitiation of blood.

Thus ends the nineteenth chapter entitled Vasti-vidhi Adhyaya of Sutra
Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In this chapter Vasti-vidhi, Acarya Vagbhata explained the process of vasti in detail.
Definition of vasti, importance, advantages and types such as asthapana, anuvasana, uttara
vasti. Indications and contraindications of asthapana vasti, anuvasana vasti, vastinetra, vasti
putaka and preparation of vasti yantra. Dosage of asthapana vasti dravya. Post operative care.
Types according to number—karma vasti, kala vasti, yoga vasti; and at the end, uttara vastidefinition and procedure for male and female etc. have been discussed.

Taila (sesamum oil) is the best drug of choice for nasal administration as the head is the seat for
kapha dosa and the other oleating substances are not suitable for the elimination of vitiated

* Marsa nasya acts faster and having greater benefits and also causes complications where as

* Though the eyes are exhausted by strong collyrium, the eyes will regain its strength due to
the following reasons—
• By good sleep.
• Due to cool nature of nighttime.
• As the eyes are predominant with agni bhuta and being habituated to cold comforts.
* Hence it is advised to apply strong collyrium during night hours.

* During daytime also, strong collyrium can be applied in the following conditions:
• Whenever kapha is predominantly vitiated.
• Diseases like sukra-arma etc. which are suitable for lekhana (scarification).
• Whenever the sun is not so hot.

Metals are born from stones and they will attain their sharpness (by rubbing on it) as well as

The different kinds of instruments, which will be useful to remove the foreign bodies, which
are lodged in different parts of the body, are known as yantras (instruments with blunt edges).
They will be useful to examine the piles, fistula-in-ano, application of sharp instruments,
alkalies and thermal cauterization and to protect the other parts of the body. Those instruments
are also useful to conduct guda vasti, uttara vasti, vrana vasti and other therapeutic procedures.
Ghatika yantra (pot), alabu (gourd), srhga (horns) jambavoustha salaka (jambula probe) etc.
are some of the blunt instruments.

Blunt instruments having different shapes and functions will be useful in different conditions.
Hence they are innumerable and it is not possible to mention all of them in detail and can be
fabricated according to the need of the hour by applying his mind.
Some other acaryas opined that the yantras are one hundred and one. Among those, surgeon's
hand is rightly considered as the principal instrument, for without its help no instrument can
properly be used.

The author of Astahga Sangraha has given the details regarding the tempering of sharp
instruments and the ways and means to gain the practical knowlege as follows:
Sastra payana (Tempering):
* Sharp instruments tempered with alkalies will be useful to remove the arrows, foreign
bodies lodged in the bones and to tear the bones.
* Tempered with water will be useful to tear the muscles.
* Tempered with oil will be useful for venesection and tearing the tendons.
Ways & means of gaining practical knowledge:
* The vaidya should be mastered in science and should gain the practical experience by
attending surgical operations in large numbers and also tried with puppets.
* Dissection of the cadaver is essential to learn the anatomical structures of the human body.
Bloodletting:
Kustha, visarpa, sllpada etc., are some of the diseases caused due to the vitiation of blood.
Extraction of the vitiated blood from the body by using sastras and anu sastras is known as
rakta-moksana (blood letting).

371

Salyaharana-Vidhi Adhyaya : 28

Tvpes of blood letting:
Bloodletting can be done by the following methods:
1. Pracchana (incision)
2. Siravedhana (venepuncture)
3. Jalaukaprayoga (leach application)
4. Srngavacarana (application of horn for aspiration)
5. Alabu (gourd for cupping)
6. Ghatiyantra (cupping with earthen ware).
* Pracchana is indicated to drain the accumulated blood from a particular point.
* Deep-seated blood can be extracted with the help of leach application.
* To drain the vitiated blood, which has settled in different layers of the skin, srhga, alabu
and ghati yantra will be useful.
* Venepuncture is advised whenever vitiated blood circulates in the body.
* To extract the blood vitiated by vata, horn is useful for aspiration, as it is hot and unctuous
in qualities.
* It is better to extract the blood vitiated by pitta by means of leach application as it is having
cold in nature.
* Blood vitiated by kapha can be extracted by alabu as it consists sharp and hot qualities.

Though leaches are non-poisonous they should not be used in the following conditions:
• When they do not vomit the blood completely.
• When they are applied frequently.
• Whenever they are sluggish, even after putting them into water.

* Afterwards select the suitable leaches which are non-poisonous and keep them for a while
in a bottle containing the water mixed with turmeric paste or avanti soma (sour
gruel—prepared by fermenting rice water) or butter milk and then put into pure water to
make them comfortable.
* Rub the place of leach application with the powder of dry cake of cow dung and apply the
leach.
* If the leach doesn't catch the place, pour one or two drops of ghee, mud, breast milk, blood
etc., or give a small incision.
* When it starts sucking blood it should be covered with a soft cloth soaked in cold water.
Sucking of vitiated blood:
( UrMlviffa^^^adldtTtiJMIMill-LI^Jl^RdfcleriflMf-LymilPd vHcflcfcy: 111 II )

The leaches will suck only vitiated blood from the body, similar to the swan that drinks only
milk from a mixture of milk and water.
I Due to the application of leaches the patients will gets relief from gulma, arsas, vidradhi,
kustha, vatarakta, galaroga, netra vedana, visa vikara and visarpa).

HT:

If there is any residual impure blood at the site of leach application, rub it with turmeric
powder, honey and jaggary.
Then wash the area with cold water and apply gauze piece or cotton soaked in satadhouta ghrta
or pastes prepared from sita virya dravyas such as yastimadhu, candana, uslra etc.
Effects of blood-letting:
With the removal of vitiated blood, pain and redness will be subsided immediately after the
process of bloodletting.
Need of bloodletting for a second time:
The vitiated blood is being moved from its place and stagnated deep in to the wound and
becomes sour by over night. Hence it should be let out for a second time.
Quantity of blood to be extracted:
• Maximum dose is 1 prastha or 768 ml.
• Medium dose is Vz prastha or 3 84 ml.
• Minimum dose is %prastha or 192 ml.

Srhga should not be used to aspirate the blood vitiated by kapha because of the thickness of the
blood. But it can be aspirated by means of srhga whenever vata and pitta vitiate the blood.
Notes:
The author of Astanga Sahgraha has given the details about the process of bloodletting by
means of sniga, alabu and ghati yantra as follows (A.S. Su. 35):
Srngavacarana:
* Application of horns of cow, buffalo etc. to aspirate vitiated blood from the body is known
as srngavacarana.
* Horn is of 7 inches length, and the circumference is of a thumb size and black gram size at
the base and tip respectively.
* Before starting the procedure, give a small incision at the place from where the blood is to
be aspirated and allow the blood to flow for some time. Then apply horn on the part after
wrapping a clean cloth at the base. After that, aspirate the blood from the tip of the horn
with mouth.
Alabu:
* Generally it is known as tumbi.
* Take the medium sized fruit, cut the stalk region and then remove the pulp and use the shell
for blood letting.
* Lit a lamp or a cotton piece and put it inside the fruit.
* Then give a small incision and apply this gourd by approximating the edges of the mouth so
closely that no atmospheric air enters into it.
* The lamp will be off after exhausting the oxygen inside the fruit and vacuum will be
formed, which will be helpful to suck the blood from the body.
* After 10-15 minutes remove the gourd and apply jatyadi ghrta and then bandage with
sterile cloth.
Ghati yantra:
The method of application is similar to alabu.
Pracchana:

* A long cloth piece or a rope or a leather strap is to be tied above the part of the body, where it
is selected for venesection.
* Care should be taken while conducting venesection by avoiding the places such as tendons,
joints and vital points.
* Incision should be given from downward to upword direction only.
* Incision should not be too deep, too wide and horizontal (sidewards).
Different types of blood-letting in different conditions:

* Pracchana is indicated to drain the accumulated blood from a particular point.
* Deep-seated blood can be extracted with the help of leach application.
• To drain the vitiated blood, which has settled in different layers of the skin, srriga, alabu
and ghati yantra will be useful.
* Venepuncture is advised whenever vitiated blood circulates in the body.

Thus ends the twenty-sixth chapter entitled Satra-vidhi Adhyaya of Sutra
Sthana in Astahga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.
In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata has been explained various types of surgical instruments in
ietail. 26 sharp instruments and their functions, their description; accessory instruments like
-rhga, alabu, jaloukaetc. have been discussed.

[Venesection]
••••••••••••••HHHHHEliivisi^

After 'Sastra-vidhi Adhyaya', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Siravyadha-vidhi'
(Venesection), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages.
(In the previous chapter blood letting with accessory instruments have been discussed such as
leach, horn, gourd and pot etc.
In the present chapter blood letting with the help of sharp instruments along with pre-operative
and post-operative care has been discussed.)
SIRAVYADHA (VENESECTION)
Importance of venesection:
There are a number of techniques for blood-letting, which were described earlier. Among
them, and in the therapies like purgation, venesection occupies the most important place for the
management of curable diseases.
As the water comes out and the plants die on cutting the borders of the field, vitiated blood
comes out and automatically the diseases will be cured on performing venesection.
As far as Kayacikitsa is concerned vasti karma is an important therapeutic procedure, because
almost all the curable diseases can be cured with the help of the same. Similarly siravedhana
occupies a unique position in Salya-tantra as it can manage a number of diseases.
Blood is the seat for the diseases, which were caused by the vitiation of the blood and hence
venesection is the first line of treatment suggested.
Features of pure blood:

* Pure blood is sweet and slightly salt in taste, neither too cold nor hot and liquid.
* Its color resembles as follows:
Padma (lotus flower), indragopa (bright red insect), hema (mahjistha) (rubiacordifolia),
avi, sasa lohita lohitam (resembling the blood of sheep and hare).
* Such blood is known as pure blood and it keeps the body healthy.
* The blood formed due to the in take of wholesome food cause, strength, color, complexion,
happiness and longe-vity of the body.

Due to the intake of opposite qualities of the substances and also the nature of autumn season

\lsaipa (herpes), vidradhi (abscess), pliha (enlargement of spleen), gulma (tumor),
^nisadana (decreased power of digestion), jwara (fever), mukha, netra, siroroga (diseases of
mouth, eyes and head), madatyaya (alcoholic toxicity), trsna (thirst), lavanasyata (salty taste in

mlodgara (pungent and sour eructation), bhrama (giddiness).
If the curable diseases are not responded even after the administration of the suitable drugs
having the properties like hot, cold, dry, unctuous etc; it can be inferred that the person is

By knowing the method of conducting venesection at various places in the body with the above
description, a wise physician can even perform venesection in other parts of the body by
applying his mind.
Instrument differs with musculature:
Give an incision with vrihimukha sastra (trocar having the pointed tip in a shape of a grain)
where there is excessive musculature and with kutharika sastra (small instrument with axe
shaped) in case of less musculature in a size of rice grain and half of the grain respectively.
Signs of proper, inadequate and excessive incision:

* In proper incision, blood flows out steadily and stops when tourniquet is released.
* If the incision is not adequate less quantity of blood flows freely for a short time. Hence to
promote bleeding it should be rubbed with the mixture of oil and slaked lime.
* Severe bleeding with sound occurs and stops with great difficulty will be seen in excessive
incision.
Reasons for not flowing the blood freely even after giving proper incision:
| | 3 5 ||
^ m ^ R l d l ^ l ^Wl^Pd^dd: I

Fear, fainting, loose and tight tourniquet, over eating, debility, using blunt instruments,

Hence, the dosika predominance of the swelling should be identified and managed with the
following measures such as—external application with cold substances, pouring liquid
substances, blood letting, and other purificatory measures like emesis and purgation.
Even after the above measures the swelling doesn't subsides, prefer vilayana (liquefaction)
followed by upanaha (poultices).

There will be no pain without vata, no burning sensation without pitta, no swelling without

involvement of all the tridosas along with the blood.

* As the caustic alkalies perform the functions such as excision, incision, extraction and
scarification, they are superior a m o n g all the sharp and accessory instruments.
* Caustic alkalies can be used in places where the sharp instruments failed and in conditions
such as nasal polyps, malignant tumors etc. and also in the chronic ulcers due to the

vitiation of all the tridosas.

conditions. Therefore caustic alkalies are definitely superior a m o n g all the sharp and
accessary instruments.

(a) Abhyantara parimarjana (internal administration)
(b) Bahyaparimarjana

mdravrksa, vrsa, saptacchada, naktamala, tilvaka, kadali, vibhitaki, citraka, apamarga,
agnimantha, four types of kosataki etc. should be collected along with the roots, fruits,
leaves and branches and cut into pieces and made into heap.
* Another heap of crystals of limestone should also be made near the heaps of the logs of
muskaka, all these set on fire and the ashes are collected.
* Then take the above ash and add 4 times water and 4 times cow's urine and stirred well and
then filter it with a thick cloth till a clear, red, thick liquid is obtained.
* The precipitate is kept on an oven and cooked nicely similar to that of snehapaka. During

cooking. There is no need of adding the paste of prativapa dravya.
(c) Tiksna ksarapaka-vidhi:

(easily dissolving), 9.
a visyandl (no exudations) and 10. na ca atiruk (or) alparuk (causing little pain)—these are the
:en qualities of ksara.
These ksaras can perform many a number of functions such as excision, incision, extraction,
scarification etc. of sharp and accessory instruments as well as cauterization.
These ksaras by their actions of sucking, tormenting and spreading everywhere, they eradicate
the root cause and eliminate the vitiated dosas f r o m the body. A f t e r subsiding the pain and
ther symptoms of the disease, the alkali also subsides of its o w n accord.
Notes:
K vira dosa: The following ten ksara dosas are mentioned in Astahga Sangraha:
: Atyusna (very hot), 2. ati sita (very cold), 3. ati tiksna (very strong), 4. ati mrdu (very mild),
5 ati tanu (very thin), 6. atighana (very thick), 7. ati picchila (too slimy), 8. visarpl (spreading

prepared).

MAULIKA SIDDHANTA
(BASIC PRINCIPLES)

SRSTI-UTPATTI
[CREATION OF UNIVERSE]
The word 'srsti is derived from the dhatu—'srji visargd, which means that is created, produced
or manifested. Srsti-utpatti krama mentioned in Ayurveda is based on Sahkhya and Vaisesika
philosophies.
The word 'tattwal is used to denote the causative factors of the creation. According to Sahkhya
darsana, the universe is created by twentyfive (25) tattwas and mentioned that prakrti and
purusa are the basic causative factors for the creation. Susruta also expressed the similar
opinion.
Neither prakrti nor purusa is able to do creation independently. When prakrti comes in contact
with purusa, prakrti gets stimulated and united together and loses its balance, which leads to a
variety of changes. These changes result in creation and the evolutionary process is as follows.

According to the Sahkhya philosophy everything in the universe looked upon as the result of
the transformation within one primordial substance known as prakrti. The subject of the
knowledge is called purusa and the object of knowledge is prakrti. As prakrti is the primordial
;ause of the universe of everything excepting only soul, which is uncaused, and accounts for
w hatever is physical, both matter and force, it is called pradhana. All creation is the result of a
relationship established between these two. Still there is a unity which underlies this duality.

510

Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

Synonyms of prakrti:
1. Pradhana: As it is the primordial substance for the creation.
l.Avidya: Which is devoid of knowledge.
3. Maya: Which causes for a variety of creation.
4. Sakti: Substratum for energy.
5. Avyakta: As the entire creation is concealed in it in a subtle form.

Avyakta is responsible for the creation of entire universe and is causeless for its manifestation,
characterized by trigunas viz. sattva, rajas and tamas, having eight forms (avyakta, mahat,
ahankara and five (5) tanmatras). It is one and one only and the substratum for numerous souls
similar to an ocean, which is a substratum for many a number of aquatic mobile and immobile
beings such as fish, lotus etc.

Mahat tattwa:
The first and the foremost basic element manifested from avyakta is known as mahat or buddhi
tattwa (intelligence). It is the element which takes the decisions while doing any actions and
differentiates between the right and wrong. It possesses all the trigunas.
Ahankara:
Ahankara is manifested from mahat or buddhi tattva and is also known as egoism. Ahankara
also contains trigunas in a state of imbalanced state, so that variation of different individuals
can be seen. Depending on the dominance of trigunas, it is of three (3) types viz.
1.
2.
3.

Sattvika ahankara or vaikarika
Rajasika ahankara or taijasa
Tamasika ahankara or bhutadi

® Sattvika ahankara with the initiation of rajasika ahaiikaia leads to the formation of
ekadasa indriyas viz.
1. Pahca jhanedriyas—srotendriya, twagindriya (sparSanendriya), caksurindriya,
rasanendriya and ghranendriya.
2. Pahca karmcndriyas— vak, hasta, upastha, payu and pada.
3. Manas.

511

Maulika Siddhanta

•

Tamasika ahahkara with the initiation of rajasika ahahkara leads to the formation of:
1. Panca tanmatras viz. sabda tanmatra, sparsa tanmatra, rupa tanmatra, rasa
tanmatra and gandha tanmatra. These five (5) tanmatras possess five visesa
gunas and evolve;
2. Panca mahabhutas viz. akasa, vayu, tejasjala and prthivi.

In this way all the twentyfive (25) tattvas necessary for creation are evolved.
Classification of tattvas:
According to the Sahkhya philosophy, all the twentyfive (25) tattvas have been classified into
four groups as under.

The basic element which manifests the rest of tattvas is known as prakrti or mula prakrti. But it
is not being created by any other substance.
2. Vikrti:
These types of elements are being created from other tattvas and they are unable to create any
other elements. They are sixteen (16) in number viz. eleven (11) indriyas and five (5)
mahabhutas.
3. Prakrti-vikrti:
These types of elements are being created from other tattvas and they are able to create other
elements. They are seven (7) in number viz. mahat, ahahkara and five (5) tanmatras.
4. Na prakrti-na vikrti:
This tattva cannot be produced any other element and itself is not created by any other, i.e.

tattvas; avyakta, mahat, ahahkara and five (5) tanmatras are called as astavidha prakrti
(causative source) and the rest of sixteen (16) are considered as sodasa vikara (products).

TANTRA YUKTI-VICARA

[MAJOR DEVICES]
In the good olden days each and every scientific work, irrespective of its subject matter was
written in accordance with Tantrayuktis or the Major Devices. The scientific works written in
brief need not contain all the 36 major devices. In other words the number of devices in a
scientific treatise depends upon the volume of subject matter.
The word tantryukti comprises two constituents viz. tantra and yukti. Tantra means a science or
scientific treatise and yukti means a device. Thus tantryukti means devices of composing a
scientific treatise. It is not possible to compose a scientific work without tantrayuktis or major
devices.
These devices are 32 in number according to Kautilya and Susruta (Uttaratantra 65"' chapter),
•s hereas Maharsi Caraka and Vagbhata enumerated the number of tantrayuktis as 36, in the 12h
chapter of Siddhisthana of Caraka Samhita and 50'h chapter of Uttaratantra respectively.
Bhattara Haricandra, the commentator on Caraka Samhita has recognized four (4) more
devices and enumerated 40 tantrayuktis.

here the sequence of saririka dosas should be taken as vata, pitta and kapha only and line of
treatment is vasti, virecana and vamana respectively. In the entire text the order of mentioning

reason.
10. Sandigdham:

It is a treatise which is composed with the descriptions and discussions something over and
over again. If the same subject matter is repeated again and again the reader gets bored and do at

be taken as mercury.
11.Prakrtakhya:
yi<£H HIM—

Interpretation of the words in a scientific treatise according to the context is known as
prakrtakhya.
Ex.: (a) in the context of war, the word 'saindhava' should be taken to mean a 'horse' and when it
is that of medicine; it should be taken to mean 'rock salt'.

13. Paratantra pratyaya:

Maulika Siddhanta

529

Taking references from other allied scientific works to explain a topic is known as
paratantra pratyaya.
Ex.: referring vaisesika darsana for knowing more about sad padarthas mentioned in

demarcation between the major and minor causes of an effect.
Ex.: pittatlsara leads to raktatisara. Here pitta is the primary cause for raktatlsara and not the
atisara.

To speak of an effect as a cause and cause as an effect in a secondary sense is known as karyakarana dharma.
Ex.: rogas do at times called as dosas and vice versa.
16. Adyanta viparyaya:
To alter the sequence of the arrangement of the chapters or subject matter contrary to previous
one or the original order according to pratijha vakya for valid reasons is known as adyanta
viparyaya.
17. Sabdanyatwa:
h i h — M i l l i j y i c d cjuf-yf-d yil^<£>d: I
To recommend or make a note of identical scientific terms is known as sabdanyatwa. These
synonyms will be helpful for clear understanding of a scientific work without any ambiguity.
Ex.: papma, jwara, vyadhi, vikara, duhkha, amaya, yaksma, atanka, gada, badha etc. are the
synonyms for roga.
18. Pratyaya dharma:
TJrERTtnrf^—'Efr^-g-t^tlMfuMfrim^Ul^r^Hf^^r^H oiJMfc^il^ I

Keeping the real cause of the effect hidden and giving importance to the insignificant cause is
known as pratyaya dharma.

530

Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra-sthana

Ex: though prajhaparadha is the real cause for unmada, giving undue importance to the
insignificant cause of invasion of pisacas.
19. Upanaya:
H I M — ^ ^ S J W I ^ H AHI-^rycMUiyM-fl-Mr) I

Upanaya is to draw near or closer. That means deliberating the allied subject matter in
introducing a major topic.
Ex.: after introducing the topic on the quantity of food (matrahara adhyaya), begins to discuss
about the disease condition' visucika1, resulting from excessive intake of food.
20. Sambhava:
T ^ l l d l H I M — y e h i u i g T ' f t t J l t i H M H f c t a "UMeh^l^fleh^H yil^OT ot( |

I <-1 rl I

Mentioning the major topics or subject matter briefly, what the author intended to discuss in
detail in his work is known as sambhava arthasraya.
Ex.: mentioning of "kayabalagraha....jaravrsan" reveals that the author intended to explain in
detail about all the 8 branches of Ayurveda in his work.
21. Vibhava:
Since Arunadatta's manuscript is mutilated after the word bhangya
formulate a precise idea about vibhava.

ABOUT THE BOOK
This book Astanga Hrdaya : Sutra
Sthana is first of its kind in the history of
Ayurvedic literature, which has been
presented with a maximum number of
illustrations for better understanding the
subject matter by the freshly joined
students of Ayurveda. As a teacher of the
concerned subject for the past 15 years,
the author has identified the necessity of
proper study material in English language
to cater the needs of 1st year B A M S
students. Keeping this in view the author
has made an attempt to incorporate the
translation of the text along with the
related

matter

compiled

from

other

Compendiums in the form of notes. The
book is supplemented with Annexure
containing

Important

Essay

&

Short

Questions, Important Slokas to be learnt
by heart, Alphabetical Index of the Herbs,
Table of Weights and Measures, Glimpse
of Astanga Hrdaya and Glossary

of

Sanskrit Terms. The present text book is
primarily

written

for

undergraduate

students of Ayurveda as per latest CCIM
Syllabus 2012. However, it is hoped that
Teachers,

PG

Scholars

and

General

Practitioners would also find it useful as a
reference book.
