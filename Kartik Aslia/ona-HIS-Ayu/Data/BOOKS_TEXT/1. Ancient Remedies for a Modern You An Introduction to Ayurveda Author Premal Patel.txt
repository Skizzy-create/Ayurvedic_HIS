     and kapha dominant people may accumulate 
     weight more readily and have more difficulty 
     losing it. As the digestion can be sluggish, the 
     person may feel sleepy or tired after eating.

  •  Personality: A kapha person may be described 
     as “down to earth” or “solid as a rock” (notice 
     the reference to earthy qualities); there is a 
     tendency toward being grounded, stable, patient, 
     compassionate, and nurturing. Once a kapha grabs 
     ahold of something, he or she holds on tight—this 
     frequently means a person with a good memory 
     and/or firm beliefs. These same qualities also make 
     kapha folk prone to inflexibility, possessiveness, 
     hesitancy toward change, jealousy, and inertia.



What is Your Constitution?

What are your qualities, tendencies, and proclivities—
physically, mentally, and emotionally? Do you have a 
predominance of one of these doshas? Or do you find that 
the qualities of one come forth strongly while you also 
display a number of characteristics related to another
dosha? What is your Ayurvedic blueprint?

You can take a quiz to help determine your prakriti, and 
see more examples of features associated with vata, pitta, 
and kapha, on the Banyan Botanicals website.

After taking this quiz, you may also choose to receive 
general daily guidelines to help maintain your ideal dosha 
balance.

Most importantly, remember to give your food 
some love. The Ayurvedic point of view is that on a 
subtle level, the intention and emotion that go into

food is one of the most healthy things you can do, as 
opposed to falling into guilt, haste, or indifference.

Eventually, thinking of your food in this way becomes 
second nature and you can choose your foods wisely 
without worrying about too many rules. If you take just 
a few minutes to observe how you feel after every meal, 
you naturally start recognizing the effects of various food
