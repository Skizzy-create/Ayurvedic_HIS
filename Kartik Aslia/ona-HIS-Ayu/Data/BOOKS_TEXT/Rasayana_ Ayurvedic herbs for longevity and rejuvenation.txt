Foreword

Ayurveda, the Ancient Science of Hindus and Indians, dates back about 7000 years.
It has eight branches, one of which is Rasayana Tantra. The word rasayana literally
means the path that rasa takes (rasa: the primordial tissue or plasma; ayana: path)
(Charaka). It is also considered as the science which restores youth, alleviates suffering
(diseases) and bestows longevity (Sushruta). It is believed in Ayurveda, that the qualities of the rasa-dhatu inﬂuence the health of other dhatus (tissues) of the body. Hence,
any medicine that improves the quality of rasa are called as rasayanas, resulting in the
strengthening or promoting of the qualities and health of all tissues of the body. These
rasayana plants are said to possess the following properties:
–
–
–
–
–
–

Prevent ageing
Re-establish youth
Strengthen life
Strengthen brain and mind
Prevent disease
Promote healthy longevity

Rasayana Tantra appears to have been practiced as an independent clinical discipline primarily as a positive health medicine. With the passage of time this important
branch of knowledge has ceased to be in practice (except the knowledge and use of a
few herbs) in its appropriate form. Comprehensive efforts are needed to revive this
useful discipline for the welfare of humanity at large.
The ability to adapt to a given habitat is a distinctive feature of all living organisms. Any type of demand (external or internal) in this habitat elicits either a speciﬁc
or non-speciﬁc response (Selye,1983). This non-speciﬁc response to any demand has
been deﬁned as stress and the demand as stressor by Hans Selye. As per his description
there are three stages of response to any given situation of stress, which together
constitute the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) (Selye,1946), the stages being a) alarm
reaction b) resistance and c) exhaustion. Thus, the ability to develop resistance and to
maintain it is crucial for coping with a variety of stressors encountered in human life.
The desire to control the coping mechanisms has led to the origin of the science of
adaptation. The branch of Ayurveda which deals with the science of adaptation is called
Rasayana Tantra. Ayurveda may not coin the term adaptogen, but those practices, or
substances / herbs / medicines which help a person cope with his day to day stresses are
known in Ayurveda as Rasayanas. Modern research has proved that herbs listed as
Rasayanas possess adaptogenic properties as well (Dahanukar, 1986.).
All of the above imply that they improve and increase the resistance of the body.
The scientiﬁc studies carried out on most of the rasayana herbs showed that these

Foreword ix
plants non-speciﬁcally activated the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and other components of the immune system as well (Dahanukar, 1986). Knowing that the central
nervous system, endocrine system and the immune system participate in intense crosstalk (Ader et al., 1990; Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser, 1994), it was easy to hypothesize
that by acting on the immune system these rasayanas could exert broad-based effects
by initiating a massive cascade of events involving various neurotransmitters, hormones and amines of the stress response cycle.
With the emerging science of ecogenetics, it is becoming evident that genetic
predisposition can alter responses to the external environment. However, at present
most of the data is on diseases, which manifest in genetically predisposed persons on
exposure to the external stressors. Can rasayanas (or adaptogens or immunomodulators)
inﬂuence genetic control and favour the maintenance of homeostasis in stressful situations? The research on Amruta (Tinospora cordifolia) opens up a new vision in this
direction, as early experiments have shown that it increases the bone marrow proliferative fractions leading to leucocytosis. A slight increase in dose reverses this process and
inducing apoptosis, and this apparent paradox was believed to be because of its effect on
c-myc, a gene that causes both proliferation as well as induces apoptosis depending on
the environment. These are some of the recent advances seen in the ﬁeld of rasayana
drugs. Looking at it it appears that rasayana herbs act as:
–
–
–
–
–

an adaptogen
an immunostimulant
an immunomodulater
pro-host probiotic
anti-mutagenic

But Ayurveda has much more in it to be included under rasayana therapy. Looking
at only a few herbs will be doing an injustice to the holistic approach of Ayurveda,
hence a brief description of Rasayana Tantra may be necessary here.
According to Ayurvedic concept rasayana therapy simultaneously affects the
body and the mind and bring about physical and psychic improvement. This therapy
prevents the effects of early ageing, develops intelligence and increases the bodyresistance against diseases.
Rasayana means vitalizing / rejuvenating. In the words of Charaka with a rasayana,
one obtains longevity, regains youth, vitality and vigour, gets a sharp memory, intellect and
freedom from diseases, gets a lustrous complexion and the strength of a horse. Sushruta is more
speciﬁc, describing a rasayana as one which, is anti-ageing, increases life-span, promotes
intelligence and memory and increases resistance to disease.
Any drug, diet or conduct that leads to the replenishment of the dhatus and enlivens
the body and mind is rasayana. Rasayana not only rejuvenates the body and mind, it
also prevents disease. There are a number of drugs/materials described which possess
the qualities of maintaining health, prolonging life and warding off diseases. They are
all grouped as rasayana in Ayurveda. A close look at the concept of rasayana of
Ayurveda and various research ﬁndings on rasayana suggests that rasayana therapy/
drug may have its effect on our ojas, immunity, resistance, etc. Hence the following points
related to the concept of resistance, immunity as described in Ayurveda may be useful:
1. The qualitative, quantitative and functional balance of the body-elements maintains strength which, in general, causes resistance to diseases. Raktam (Blood) has

x

Foreword

been attached much importance because it’s normal condition reﬂects good health
and general resistance power.
2. Ayurveda has described a separate substance named ojas which has been said
to be the essence of all the dhatus and is considered to be an excellent body
element. Therefore, the excellence of the body in totality is ojas. It reﬂects
the excellent performance of the man as a whole. Therefore, resistance power of
the body depends on the quality and quantity of ojas.
3. Bala (strength or power) has been classiﬁed as sahaja (natural, hereditary), kalakrita
(variable as per age and season) and yuktikrita (acquired by good diet, drug
and exercise etc.). This is why some families have a speciﬁc resistance to speciﬁc
diseases; some diseases are born in a speciﬁc age and season and generally speaking
those, who are well built, fall less ill.
4. Again the bala (resistance) has been divided into vyadhi pratibandhakatwa and
vyadhi bala virodhitwa bala. The former is the speciﬁc resistance against
a speciﬁc disease so that those diseases will never afﬂict the man. Today, vaccines
substitute this type of resistance. The latter does not stop the onset of the disease
but can only minimise its severity. In another context it has been said that the
overweight or emaciated, those of weak build, who have a deﬁcient diet and who
are mentally weak, are more susceptible to disease (Ch.Su.28/7).
There are various ways of classifying rasayana therapy in Ayurveda. They are basically either based on the method of administering the rasayana therapy, such as kutipravesika (indoor) or vataatapika (outdoor); or based on the effect. Kaamya (invigorating
and vitalizing), medhya (promoting intellectual factors), achara (address psycho-somatic
activities), naimittika (used to promote resistance against disease following illness)
and vrishya (virilifying or sex-stimulant). Also remember that Rasayana Tantra is one
of the eight branches (Asthanga Ayurveda) of Ayurveda. And, before administering
rasayana the individual needs to undergo the shodana/panchakarma (puriﬁcation therapy)
process. Kaya-kalpa is nothing but another name for rasayana.
The importance of Ayurveda in countries outside of India continues to increase. In
order to meet the demand in the United Kingdom for qualiﬁed personnel, there
has been established, for the ﬁrst time in the UK, a ﬁrst degree course in the subject
at Thames Valley University. It is a three-year degree course with the opportunity
afterwards for continuing the course in India for a fourth year at Kottakal (or Manipal
University). This degree course is run in conjunction with the world’s ﬁrst Charitable
Ayurvedic Hospital outside of India and Sri Lanka which is based in London.
In the light of the extreme importance of rasayana in Ayurvedic therapy it is
appropriate that Dr Harsharnjit Puri’s book on rasanaya is being published by Taylor
& Francis. I congratulate him on producing this excellent reference book with detailed
explanations on the activity of each drug.
However, as a persistent defender of the intellectual property and patent rights of
Ayurvedic doctors and Indian Ayurveda, I hope that this book will be read by those
with a spirit of learning and not as a commercial tool for attempts to synthesize these
medicines or for using them as herbs in non-Ayurvedic traditions.

Preface to the series

Global warming and global travel are among the factors resulting in the spread of such
infectious diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and HIV. All these are not well
controlled by the present drug regimes. Antibiotics too are failing because of bacterial
resistance. Formerly less well known tropical diseases are reaching new shores. A
whole range of illnesses, for example cancer, occur worldwide. Advances in molecular
biology, including methods of in vitro testing for a required medical activity give new
opportunities to draw judiciously upon the use and research of traditional herbal
remedies from around the world. The re-examining of the herbal medicines must be
done in a multidisciplinary manner.
Since 1997 twenty volumes have been published in the Book Series Medicinal and
Aromatic Plants – Industrial Proﬁles. The series continues. It is characterised by a
single plant genus per volume. With the same Series Editor, this new series Traditional Herbal Medicines for Modern Times, covers multi genera per volume. It
accommodates for example, the Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM), the Japanese
Kampo versions of this and the Ayurvedic formulations of India. Collections of plants
are also brought together because they have been re-evaluated for the treatment of
speciﬁc diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, cancer, diabetes, etc. Yet other collections are of the most recent investigations of the endemic medicinal plants of
a particular country, e.g. of India, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil (with its vast ﬂora), or
of Malaysia with its rainforests said to be the oldest in the world, etc.
Each volume reports on the latest developments and discusses key topics relevant to
interdisciplinary health science research by ethnobiologists, taxonomists, conservationists, agronomists, chemists, pharmacologists, clinicians and toxicologists. The Series is
relevant to all these scientists and will enable them to guide business, government
agencies and commerce in the complexities of these matters. The background to the
subject is outlined below.
Over many centuries, the safety and limitations of herbal medicines have been
established by their empirical use by the healers who also took a holistic approach. The
healers are aware of the infrequent adverse affects and know how to correct these when
they occur. Consequently and ideally, the pre-clinical and clinical studies of a herbal
medicine need to be carried out with the full cooperation of the traditional healer. The
plant composition of the medicine, the stage of the development of the plant material,
when it is to be collected from the wild or when from cultivation, its post-harvest
treatment, the preparation of the medicine, the dosage and frequency and much other
essential information is required. A consideration of the intellectual property rights
and appropriate models of beneﬁt sharing may also be necessary.

Preface to the series xiii
Wherever the medicine is being prepared, the ﬁrst requirement is a well documented reference collection of dried plant material. Such collections are encouraged by
organisations like the World Health Organisation and the United Nations Industrial
Development Organisation. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in the UK is building
up its collection of traditional Chinese dried plant material relevant to its purchase
and use by those who sell or prescribe TCM in the UK.
In any country, the control of the quality of plant raw material, of its efﬁcacy and of
its safety in use, are essential. The work requires sophisticated laboratory equipment
and highly trained personnel. This kind of control cannot be applied to the locally
produced herbal medicines in the rural areas of many countries, on which millions of
people depend. Local traditional knowledge of the healers has to sufﬁce.
Conservation and protection of plant habitats is required and breeding for biological diversity is important. Gene systems are being studied for medicinal exploitation.
There can never by too many seed conservation banks to conserve genetic diversity.
Unfortunately such banks are usually dominated by agricultural and horticultural
crops with little space for medicinal plants. Developments such as random ampliﬁed
polymorphic DNA enable the genetic variability of a species to be checked. This can
be helpful in deciding whether specimens of close genetic similarity warrant storage.
From ancient times, a great deal of information concerning diagnosis and the use
of traditional herbal medicines has been documented in the scripts of China, India
and elsewhere. Today, modern formulations of these medicines exist in the form of
e.g. powders, granules, capsules and tablets. They are prepared in various institutions
e.g. government hospitals in China and Korea, and by companies such as Tsumura
Co. of Japan with good quality control. Similarly, products are produced by many
other companies in India, the USA and elsewhere with a varying degree of quality
control. In the USA, the dietary supplement and Health Education Act of 1994
recognised the class of physiotherapeutic agents derived from medicinal and aromatic plants. Furthermore, under public pressure, the US Congress set up an Ofﬁce
of Alternative Medicine and this ofﬁce in 1994 assisted the ﬁling of several Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, required for clinical trials of some Chinese
herbal preparations. The signiﬁcance of these applications was that each Chinese preparation involved several plants and yet was handled as a single IND. A demonstration of the contribution to efﬁcacy, of each ingredient of each plant, was not required.
This was a major step forward towards more sensible regulations with regard to
phytomedicines.
Something of the subject of western herbal medicines is now being taught again to
medical students in Germany and Canada. Throughout Europe, the USA, Australia
and other countries pharmacy and health-related schools are increasingly offering
training in phytotherapy.
TCM clinics are now common outside of China. An Ayurvedic Hospital now exists
in London and a degree course in Ayurveda is also available here.
The term integrated medicine is now being used which selectively combines traditional herbal medicine with modern medicine. In Germany there is now a hospital in
which TCM is integrated with western medicine. Such co-medication has become
common in China, Japan, India, and North America by those educated in both systems. Beneﬁts claimed include improved efﬁcacy, reduction in toxicity and the period
of medication, as well as a reduction in the cost of the treatment. New terms such
as adjunct therapy, supportive therapy, and supplementary medicine now appear as a

xiv Preface to the series
consequence of such co-medication. Either medicine may be described as an adjunct to
the other depending on the communicator’s view.
Great caution is necessary when traditional herbal medicines are used by those
doctors not trained in their use and likewise when modern medicines are used by
traditional herbal doctors. Possible dangers from drug interactions need to be stressed.

Preface

Ayurveda – the science of life, has been divided into eight disciplines. Whereas the
ﬁrst six disciplines can be easily related to similar topics of modern medical science,
the last two Rasayana and Vajikarna, are unique in themselves and until recently were
least understood. Initially Rasayana was equated with tonics, elixirs and alteratives,
which helped rejuvenation of all systems in the body and hence longevity. Vajikarna,
also spelled Bajikarna – which means to impart (sexual) power of the horse, and also
translates as the science of procreation, were considered aphrodisiacs.
This overemphasis on herbs as elixirs and for sexual purposes is not unique to
Ayurveda; the study of other oriental materia medica reveals more or less the same story.
Recent developments have also shown that the concept of sexual deﬁciencies, real or
imaginary, is widespread all over the world in different populations, as has became
evident from the success of a preparation for erectile dysfunction (impotence) in males.
Whereas in modern times the emphasis is on sexual pleasure, in ancient India the
preparations were required for reproduction to replenish the depleted population.
Manpower was required, not only for day-to-day agricultural and industrial activities
but also for wars to defend the existing territory and to acquire more land from nature
and from other communities. With little knowledge in the prevention and cure of
diseases, the death rate was very high, both from natural and unnatural causes. It
necessitated the search for herbs, which would not only help in reproduction but also
in prolonging life by keeping the body healthy and disease free.
The herbs used for the above purposes had diverse physiological actions on the
body, such as sexual stimulant, tranquilizer, liver protection, diuretic, bronchiodilator,
etc. When subjected to detailed pharmacological activity in the last century, in most
cases these herbs had a mild pharmacological effect on the body and it was said that
herbs used as Rasayana and Vajikarna helped the body due to their placebo effect.
After India’s independence in 1947, more attention was paid to research on Indian
medicinal plants, particularly those used in Ayurveda, but for about half a century
much of the information on these herbs remained conﬁned to India, as most of these
research ﬁndings were published in Indian journals, which had only local circulation
and were not even abstracted by multinational publishers. The international journals
at that time were not interested in the publication of the routine type of research
work, or the Ayurvedic polyherbal, polymineral preparations, processed in the traditional way, where nothing was known about the exact chemical nature of the active
constituents with certainty. Mostly the articles on Indian medicines submitted
to these journals were returned back to the author with the remark local interest only.
Studies on ginseng, Panax ginseng, was a trendsetter for research on herbs, considered

xvi

Preface

as a tonic. Ginseng did not have a strong pharmacological activity but it showed
diverse beneﬁcial effects on the human body. In the meantime, in the Soviet Union
(the present Russia and other Republics), a new group of herbs, called adaptogens,
were discovered. It was observed that by the use of these herbs, the body adapts itself
to adverse environmental conditions. These herbs were found to combat stress, kept
infections away by their immunomodulating activity and thus helped to promote a
long life of good quality.
Recent research has shown that many Ayurvedic herbs used as Rasayana act as
adaptogens. In this book, an effort has been made to refer to all the lesser known
articles on these herbs, so that the interested reader may obtain detailed information
about them. In addition to these, some other herbs, which in Indian folklore are
considered to have Rasayana type activities, have also been included, with the hope
that further research on them may discover some new therapeutic active substance.
In the introductory chapters of the book the concept of Rasayana, and an allied
subject Tridosha is explained, along with the methods used for preparing various
Ayurvedic products. The main part of the text is concerned with the herbs used as
Rasayana: each chapter is devoted to a single herb. In the Contents, the Indian names
of these herbs are followed by their botanical names in parentheses. In the text,
English names are also mentioned; botanical and Indian names are italicized. While
describing various formulations, to avoid confusion, instead of botanical binomial
nomenclature, mostly generic names of the plants are given. Where more than one
part of the herb is used, the plant part is given along with the name of the herb. In the
cases where a particular herb is processed, speciﬁc information about this has been
provided. When describing a herb, Ayurvedic name, botanical name, brief description,
distribution of the plant and illustration is followed by its uses in folklore and Ayurveda.
Brief information on pharmacology and therapeutic studies have also been provided if
recent research conﬁrms the common claims for the herb. An account of some important polyherbal, polymineral formulations used as Rasayana and Vajikarna, are also
given.
When Dr R. Hardman, the series editor, mentioned the new series, Traditional
Herbal Medicine for the Modern Times, I suggested he include a book on Rasayana. In the
earlier part of my career, I had surveyed the literature and conducted some research on
the plants used in both Rasayana and Vajikarna. The present book, which describes
herbs, is the ﬁrst part of the study on Rasayana. In the second part, information will
been given about the role that Rasayana plays in our daily life, along with a description of animal products, gems and minerals. I am grateful to Dr Hardman for the
guidance and help while preparing the manuscript for the book. During my stay at
Herb Pharm Inc., Williams (Or. USA), Mr Ed Smith was kind enough to provide me
with a computer and other facilities during the preparation of the manuscript. Thanks
are also due to Dr Naresh, of the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh
(India), for library help and occasional discussion, Mr V.K. Sawhney for typing some
sections and Mr Naresh Bagga, for the line drawings of the plants.
My son Avon Puri, my wife Harminder Puri, Thorin Halverson, Ashneet Puri and
Vikram Malhotra also helped me during the preparation of the manuscript for this
book.

Introduction

Disease (dis-ease), is the disturbance of ease i.e. comfort, freedom from constraint,
annoyance, awkwardness, pain or trouble both bodily and mental. Since time immemorial, man has tried to lead a disease free life. In one of the oldest repositories of
human knowledge, vedas of Aryans (veda means to know, knowledge), the plants with
medicinal virtues have been identiﬁed as oushidhis which are to be distinguished from
ahara the edible plants. After vedas, further developments in various spheres of human
life gave rise to Indian medicine called Ayurveda (Ayuh – life, veda – science).
Dhanwantri, said to be the father of Indian medicine, lived in 7th century BC., as
compared to Hippocrates who lived in 5th century BC. After Dhanwantri, the system
of Ayurveda developed further, and peaked at the time of Charak Sanhita and Sushrut
Sanhita, the treatises on medicine and surgery written about 1000 BC to 1000 AD.
Charak Sanhita is said to be a compilation of proceedings of a symposium held in the
Himalayas, to discuss the cure of various diseases which had originated at that time
due to urbanization. For this purpose, the ancient scholar divided Ayurveda into the
following eight disciplines:

Internal medicine
Ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology
Surgery
Toxicology
Psychiatry
Paediatrics
Rasayana, which in broad terms means rejuvenator
Vajikarna, the literal meaning is to have the sex power of a horse, but is often
considered as fertility inducer or procreator.

As the present studies show, it is difﬁcult to distinguish between Rasayana and
Vajikarna. The sexual system is fully dependent on the proper function of mind and
body, so a good Vajikarna has to be a good Rasayana. Initially Rasayana preparations
were herbal and were prescribed as dietary supplements. Some were administered
under controlled conditions, whereas the Vajikarna included poisons, minerals, animal
products and narcotics like Cannabis and opium.
Further developments in Ayurveda took place with the incorporation of herbs discovered in other countries and by contacts with medical scholars from other parts of
the world. These developments lead to the incorporation of more and more substances,
particularly minerals in Ayurvedic materia medica. By the time of Bhavparkasha in the

2

Introduction

ﬁfteenth century AD, Ayurveda had become a composite science, covering all aspects
of human activities, even including recipes on nutritive foods.
Initially, Ayurveda developed as the medical science of the Aryans settled mainly in
the Indo-Gangetic region, but later, ﬁndings of physicians from other parts of India
were also incorporated into it. In east and south India, Ayurveda developed with the
same basic principles but with a focus on local ﬂora, and on physiotherapy. Progress in
gemology and metallurgy had its effect on medicine also. For boosting the effects of
herbal preparations, a large number of minerals, particularly mercury, with a miraculous
power against microbes, became an integral part of Ayurvedic treatments (for details
see chapter on Some Rasayana Formulations).
During all these stages, Ayurveda covered all aspects of human life. The aim was
not only to make a man healthy but happy too. It did not deal with man and medicine
only, but with a way of life, which included social, moral, and religious education,
based on very intricate philosophies of Indian sages. These learned men postulated
many theories. They gave their views about the origin of the universe, the composition
of matter, and the actions and interactions in our environment, which disturb the
systems of our bodies and gives rise to many diseases and discomforts. Ayurveda
combined philosophy with science, so the life processes, which cannot be understood
by wisdom (budhi) have been explained on the basis of reasoning (yukti). These philosophical thoughts are too complex for the present purposes and only the salient features,
in a simpliﬁed manner, are given in the following chapters.
It was postulated that human health is related to constitution of body, age, sex,
geographical region, race, ancestry, and resistance power or immunity. Good health is
something more than the absence of diseases or inﬁrmity. It is a state of complete
mental, physical and social well being. As per Ayurvedic theories, the approach to
health is holistic, with less emphasis on symptomatic relief. Treatment does not mean
healing the affected part or a particular system, but the whole body. The treatment
aims at correcting the site of origin of disease, the channels of accumulation and the
site of manifestation of body poisons. For example, when there is a breathing problem,
in the conventional system antispasmodics and bronchodilators are prescribed but in
Ayurveda polyherbal preparations are given, in which some of the ingredients may
have an antispasmodic effect but some others act on the stomach and intestine, from
where the disease might have originated. This diagnosis is based on tridosha, the three
biological factors in the human systems, around which Ayurvedic physiology, pathology and therapeutics revolve. In broad terms tridosha represents metabolic disturbances, and various treatments are given to keep the three doshas in order. Balancing
of the doshas is required for a good old age and also for the day-to-day activities of
modern life. It has been stressed that medicaments, particularly Rasayana, work only if
the conditions within the body are conducive for their effect. During treatment, due
importance has also been given to the mind, which is a powerful agent in causation
and cure of diseases. Emotions, anger and pride are also treated as diseases. These affect
the health, happiness and longevity of an individual.
Recent studies also conﬁrm these observations. According to a leading Indian cardiologist (Dr H.S. Wasir) negative emotions like greed, ego, anger and too much materialistic attachment lead to high blood pressure, aggravation of angina and heart attack.
Positive emotions have a beneﬁcial effect on heart function and prevent an upsurge in
blood pressure. Music, meditation, and yogic excesses help in settling the mind.
A good way of life is also conducive to good health. Aachar – good conduct, Vichar

Introduction 3
– good thoughts, Vyahar – good interpersonal dealing, and Ahar – good food habits,
help. Both malnutrition and over-nutrition adversely affect our health and longevity.
Over-nutrition is excessive intake of calories, saturated fats of animal origin, sugar and
lack of complex carbohydrates from tubers. The diseases affecting longevity are hypertension, brain stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, cirrhosis and other hepatic disorders,
alcoholism, cardiomyopathy, and AIDS etc. The ancient Indian physicians were aware
of these, and most of the herbs prescribed as Rasayana treated one or more of the above
diseases.

What are Rasayana?

What are Rasayana?

The agents which cure body and mental diseases, delay old age, increase mental power,
generating power, vital energy, eyesight, impart intelligence, memory, aid proper
digestion and clear complexion are Rasayana (Shastri, 1979). These nourish the whole
body by strengthening the primordial tissue Rasa, the essence of all food we take, and
which the body can assimilate. If this essence is well distributed in all systems, the
body remains healthy. By their physico-chemical action Rasayana purify and promote
dhatus (tissue). They augment the body’s disease resistance capacity, as well as the
ability for restorative reaction and counteract all the deleterious effects including that
of ageing.
The Rasayana keep tissues, enzymes, membranes and tranquility of the mind in
their normal functioning conditions through anabolic processes. They help if the
tissues have become inactive, are to be revitalized and their composition changed.
They achieve this by increasing bala, the physiological and immunological strength of
the body. They are good for all people, at all stages, at all times but they do not
prevent ageing and do not assure immortality.
Rasayana may be compared to alteratives, which work as blood cleansers by their
diuretic and antihepatotoxic action. Alteratives also restore the proper functions of
the body and increase health and vitality (Hoffmann, 1998). They alter the body’s
metabolism in various ways so that the tissue can best deal with the range of function
from nutrition to elimination. Some of these herbs eliminate waste from the body
through kidney, liver, lung or skin, while others work by stimulating digestive functions
and still others act as antimicrobial agents. Some Rasayana also help in the disposal of
waste ama. Agni is the biological ﬁre burning inside the body, which acts on food so
that energy is generated by digestion. If waste is not excreted from the body properly
and ama is deposited in the tissues, it may disturb various systems. The herbs are
given to strengthen the tissue to counteract all the ill effects of ama.
In Ayurveda, human life has been divided into four spans according to growth and
development:
1
2
3

From birth to the age of 20, all tissues of the body grow.
20– 40 years of age, tissues continue to grow.
40–60 years is the age of stagnation. If an individual has a balanced diet, cheerful
life, adequate nourishment, and is free of worries and anxiety, the person can
maintain good health. At this stage the mental activities expand, and power of
judgment increases.

After the age of 60, in spite of good quality of life, senescence starts. Metabolism
of the tissues decreases, waste is not excreted properly, and the bone joints become
dry and ﬁxed.

The body can be rejuvenated at stages 3 and 4 and during senescence by Rasayana.
These can be used as a dietary supplement, but in the case of chronic diseases, old age,
etc. where kaya kalp (rejuvenation) is required, a special treatment, called Rasayana
therapy, is provided under the supervision of medical experts.
RASAYANA THERAPY
Before the start of actual therapy, the internal and external organs of the body are
cleansed and the system is made more receptive to assimilation of medication. It has
been stressed that Rasayana administered without these treatments is like seed sown
on barren land, from where no good results can be expected. This pretreatment is
given only to those persons who have enough strength to bear it.

Pretreatment for Rasayana therapy
Samshodhna (Diet restriction)
One week before the start of therapy, the person should resort to a simple diet
consisting of only steamed vegetables and fresh fruits. He should not be given sugar,
alcohol or animal products. Milk and honey are allowed.
Purvakarma (Preparatory treatment)
Involves massage with warm oil, and application of heat on the body by a massage
therapist. The massage should be so vigorous that a large amount of latent heat of
the body is generated. For this purpose sesame oil is generally used but sometimes some other medicated oils, which are supposed to have better properties, are
applied.
Panchkarma (Cleansing of internal organs of the body)
Virechna
Basti
Vamna
Naysya
Raktaoksha

purging to clean the small intestine
to clean the large intestine
emetics to clean the stomach
nasal drops to clear the respiratory passage
bloodletting by leeches may be done to those patients who have
excess of blood in their body. Nowadays blood is donated to the
blood bank. It is optional.

6

What are Rasayana?

Administration of herbs
After panchkarma the patient is admitted into a hut (kuti prveshika) for the administration of Rasayana preparations. The hut should be in a pollution-free area, well ventilated, facing north, and painted with slaked lime to make it germ-free.
The preparations required during Rasayana therapy vary, at the discretion of the health
provider. Generally the patient is given a restricted diet, along with only that quantity
of medication which the patient can easily digest. The medicine should be fully utilized by the body and not passed into faeces undigested. The medicine should not create
any digestive disturbance, such as indigestion, hyperacidity or constipation. If any of
these conditions persist for some time, a laxative or a colon cleanser should be given.
Herbs such as garlic, neem, amalaki, etc. were commonly used for this therapy but
now polyherbal preparations with animal products such as musk, amber, coral, pearl,
gems, minerals, and metals are prescribed. Some of the formulations may consist of red
sulphide of mercury, prepared in the presence of gold, along with processed poisonous
herbs like aconite, nux vomica, etc. The preparation is given to the patient in the early
hours of the morning (within three hours of sunrise). During administration of mercurial
compounds, the patient should have a pure vegetarian diet. He should not remain
thirsty or hungry. He should avoid excessive sleep, swimming, talking, anger, sadness,
desire, excessive happiness, bathing, worry, irritation, depression, sex, and fragrances.
He should lead a simple, pious, and religious life.
After kuti prevesh, the patient should start steadily with a diet of rice water, followed
by rice gruel, rice and split beans, rice with beans, and ﬁnally he may be given a
normal diet with a teaspoonful of ghee (butter oil). The patient should remain in a
relaxed condition, and should have a whole body massage daily with warm sesame oil.
This treatment is said to make the arteries softer and smoother, the constitution of the
blood changes, clots are dissolved, and new cells are formed.
RASAYANA AND VAJIKARNA
Vajikarna are Ayurvedic aphrodisiacs, and may be used in place of Rasayana. There is
no clear-cut distinction between the two, and these may be substituted for each other.
In general Vajikarna are used for the production and puriﬁcation of shukra (this term
is used for vital ﬂuid, and also for sperm and spermatic ﬂuid). The vital ﬂuid is considered the essence of all functions of the body, which result in fame, beauty, strength
and power. It is the result of all metabolic activities of the human body. If any system
of the body is disturbed, the formation of vital ﬂuid does not take place, but in a
person who is healthy, energetic, active, has good digestion, sleep, active life, nutritive
diet, regulated routine, a good household atmosphere, affectionate wife, and who
consumes milk, ghee, citrus fruits and stays away from excessive amorous activities, the
vital ﬂuid does not get depleted and hence these persons do not require any medication (aphrodisiac).

Some recent research on Rasayana and Vajikarna
Puri (1970a, b, 1971, 1972) gave an account of the herbs used in various Rasayana and
Vajikarna preparations. The other studies carried out on these aspects are as follows:

For mental diseases
Udupa (1973) was the ﬁrst to study the effects of herbs used as Rasayana on psychosomatic stress. Singh and Murthy (1989) treated patients with epilepsy syndrome with
various Rasayana preparations for one year. Seventy-ﬁve per cent of patients had less
severe ﬁts. Dwivedi and Singh (1992) prescribed Medhya Rasayana (the herbs said to
be a brain tonic), for convulsive disorders. The treatment showed signiﬁcant improvement in terms of frequency, duration and severity of seizures. Pandey and Pandey
(1995) used Rasayana because of their sedative and tranquillizing property for the
treatment of psychological and psychosomatic disorders. These preparations reduced
anxiety, apprehension, and kept the mind calm and cool.

As adaptogens and immunomodulators
Srivastava et al. (1990) tried Rasalyana preparations on people/persons exposed to high
altitudes. These herbs also helped in generalized weakness ( Jayaram et al. 1993).
Praveen Kumar et al. (1994) noted that the oral administration of Rasayana preparations protected mice from cyclophosphamide-induced leukopaenia. In this case white
blood cell count increased and there was an increase in bone marrow cellularity. The
herbs were found useful in chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.
Wagner (1994), after a detailed study, concluded that Rasayana preparations, which
act both as herbal immunostimulants and adaptogens, regulate the immunological
and endocrine systems, with relative low doses, without damaging the autoregulative
functions of the organisms. These induced a general increase in non-speciﬁc resistance
against infectious and non-infectious stresses. Mulgund and Uchil (1994) noted that
herbal formulations used as Rasayana were powerful immunostimulants. All the groups
treated with these herbal extracts showed a signiﬁcant increase in macrophage function, indicating their role in protection against stress. The rise in plasma cortisol
following stress was inhibited. Srivastava (1995) studied the effects of Ayurvedic
adaptogens on psycho-physiological performance of volunteers, up to three months at
an altitude of 4800–6000 m. These herbs improved the physical performance and
sensitivity index of oxygen availability.
In another experiment, Shetty (1995) studied the Rasayana effect of a herbal preparation consisting of six herbs, by prescribing it 3 g daily for 6 months. Extensive
clinical, biochemical, psychological, and anthropometric assessment, with direct or
indirect bearing on the ageing process, was done initially and at the end of six months.
Analysis of clinical parameters indicated that with the preparation, the diastolic blood
pressure came down within normal limits. Menon et al. (1996) observed that Brahma
Rasayana with more than twenty ingredients, inhibited methylcholanthrene (200µg)
induced sarcoma development. The preparation inhibited carcinogenesis by 80 per
cent and enhanced mouse life. Praveen Kumar et al. (1996) carried out further studies
on the oral administration of four Rasayana preparations. These signiﬁcantly increased
total leucocyte count and bone marrow cellularity. These had natural killer cell activity and antibody dependent cellular toxicity in mice exposed to gamma radiation. The
effect of Rasayana preparation could be due to increased stem cell proliferation and
also on free radical-induced injury produced by radiation.
In a review article Dahanukar and Thatte (1997) mentioned that Rasayana protected animals from infections, shortened recovery time, and lowered mortality rates.

They made antibiotics more effective at lower doses. Rasayana worked by enhancing
leucocytosis and by neutrophil destruction. Important immune functions such as
phagocytosis, intracellular killing and macrophage activity also increased in treated
animals.

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
Pathak et al. (1992) treated osteoarthritis patients, ﬁrst subjecting them to physiotherapy, for example heating the body systems with massage to cause perspiration, followed
by administration of a polyherbal Rasayana preparation containing Ashwagandha,
Guggulu, etc., with positive results.

Tridosha

Tridosha

The origin of disease in the body, as per Ayurveda, is due to metabolic disturbances in
the various systems. The aim of the Rasayana is to correct this system by balancing various ras (extracts which are manifested by a particular taste). Whatever we eat, it has
one or more of the six ras (tastes): sweet, acidic, salty, bitter, astringent and pungent.

Sweet ras
It is mainly in carbohydrates (starch- and sugar-containing substances). It nourishes
sapt dhatus (seven tissue systems in the body), i.e. chyme, blood, liver, ﬂesh, bones,
bone marrow and semen. It is good for ﬁve senses, i.e. eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin.
In excess it causes laziness, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, etc.

Acidic ras
It is mainly present in acidic fruits, except in amalaki (Emblica ofﬁcinalis), yogurt, and
fermented preparations. This ras stimulates saliva, increases the power of digestion,
imparts strength to the body, and keeps the sense organs in order. In excess it causes
hyperacidity and loss of sexual power.

Salty ras
It is mainly present in minerals. It makes food tasty and digestible. Excess of salt
causes thirst, heat, softness of muscles, premature greying of hair, wrinkles, hair loss
and loss of libido.

Bitter ras
The main sources are herbs. It cleans the mouth, increases glandular secretion, digests
food and strengthens all senses. It has an anti-inﬂammatory effect. It helps in skin
diseases, liver functions and obesity. If bitters are taken in excess they cause inﬂammation, burning sensation and make a man impotent.

Pungent ras
Mainly spices give rise to this ras. Spices do not have a good taste of their own but
make food tasty. They act as antidote to toxins and kill microbes in the food. They

Tridosha

11

cause diuresis and help in obesity. Excess of pungent ras, reduces power, energy, and
may cause sedation and hallucination.

Astringent ras
It is mainly in tannin-containing unripe fruits, barks and roots. Astringents are not
good to taste and cause dryness of the body and constipation. Excess of this ras causes
loss of virility, paralysis or other diseases of the nervous system.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RAS AND DOSHA
If a particular ras is deﬁcient or in excess, it disturbs the equilibrium or three dosha of
the body: vata, pitta and kapha. These doshas are sometimes equated with three humours
of Greek: air, bile and phlegm. These control all functions of the human body, i.e. the
biomotor force, metabolic activity and the preservative principles. When all these are
in balance in the body, they are the regenerator but if there is an imbalance in them
then they become the destroyer. There is an action and interaction between these ras
and doshas. Sweet ras suppresses vata; sweet, astringent and pungent tastes suppress
pitta; bitter, astringent and pungent tastes suppress kapha; but if bitter, pungent and
astringent are in excess then vata is corrupted; with acids, salt and bitter in excess pitta
is corrupted while sweet, acid and salt affect kapha. Sweets, acids and salt suppress bad
effects of vata, astringent, sweet and pungent help in pitta, and astringent, bitter and
pungent suppresses kapha. Thus it is clear that a particular ras increases or decreases a
particular dosha. The balanced diet, which keeps the three doshas in order, has no ras in
excess or in short supply.
In Charak Sanhita it has been stated that no self-inﬂicted disease originates without
disturbance of these doshas. Out of these three doshas, vata dominates pitta. Vata causes
the movement of kapha, the same way air causes movement of clouds in the sky.
If a particular dosha is corrupted it affects a particular system but if two doshas are
involved then the bad effect increases manifold. If both pitta and vata are corrupted
then the effect is like that of high winds on wild ﬁre. This ﬁre can only be controlled
by kapha, which acts as water. If all the three doshas become unstable the result is
disastrous.
The three doshas are:

Vata
It is equated with vayu or baya or bios of Greek. It is the life or vital force. It
differentiates the cells into different structures, creates blood vessels, lymphatic system
and nerves. Vata in the body becomes corrupted by the use of light, dry, easily
digestible food for a long time, by eating highly nutritious substances with little
roughage, by eating food in small quantities several times a day for long duration,
by consuming excessive cold drinks, excessive work, from stress arising from nonfulﬁllment of goal, due to worry, grief, panic, fear, excessive sex, sleeping late at night,
and by taking a bath for a long time. All these deplete the vital energy from the body
in the same way as it is lost during ageing. Indigestion and constipation also have
a bad effect on vata. They produce gas and may cause arthritis, muscular pain and

12

Tridosha

headache. If vata remains stable then all the ﬁve senses of the body, body systems
and organs remain stable, otherwise it causes many complications leading to chronic
diseases, and untimely death.

Pitta
It generates and preserves body heat. It manifests itself in various forms in different
biochemical activities mainly concerning digestion and assimilation of food. It brings
about metabolic activity. It is equated with heat or ﬁre. Pitta is situated between the
duodenum and stomach. It digests food by separating ras, chyme, urine, faeces, and
liberates energy for the body. Pitta works in close association with liver and spleen to
produce blood. The bad effects of pitta are due to regular use of hot, spicy, fried, sour,
and salty food, by eating food late in the evening just before sleeping, by remaining
thirsty for a long time, by exposure to heat and sun for a long time, by remaining
irritable and angry. Excess of pitta causes excess body heat, which results in hyperacidity,
haemorrhage, loss of calcium or urinary diseases like incontinence and burning
micturition. It may cause headaches, which result in restlessness, irritation and noise
phobia. If pitta ﬂares up cold, soft, sweet, bitter and astringent substances should be
used but fried, salty, spicy, acidic, non-vegetarian food, alcohol, tobacco, hard work
and sunshine should be avoided.

Kapha
It has a cooling and preservative property, and it acts like the water jacket of the
internal combustion engine. It provides the humidity required by the various systems
of the body particularly, bile, mucous membranes, gastric juices, pancreatic juices and
other systems. A person who has a good diet and good way of living remains free
from the bad effects of kapha. It helps the growth of the body by anabolic activities,
develops strength and vigour in laziness, obesity and thinness of body, and stimulates
the mind, enabling courage, tolerance, and selﬂessness, whilst discouraging greed and
lust. It imparts knowledge to do the good things by intelligence.
Kapha becomes corrupted by sweet, sour, fatty, and highly nutritious foods which
are hard to digest. It causes diseases which are cold in nature such as the common cold,
cough, bronchial troubles, loss of appetite, insomnia, and laziness. It increases mucus,
saliva, perspiration, and causes loss of virility. To control kapha avoid strong, cold,
humid wind, excess sleep, sex, greediness and lust.

Rasayana preparations 13

Rasayana preparations

The simplest mode of administering a herb is to take it as it is, to pound it or to use
its juice after ﬁltration. These are the least processed forms and all constituents of the
herb are made available to the body. However fresh herbs are often not readily available throughout the year. Some fresh herbs not only taste bad but are even nauseating.
The best alternative to fresh herbs is to use properly dried herbs in powder form (churn).
Usually the churn are mixed with salt or sugar to make them more palatable. These
powders are usually administered with a ﬂuid medium, because in a dry form they are
difﬁcult to swallow or sometimes may even choke the respiratory passage. For Rasayana
powders, the common medium for administration is boiled lukewarm cow’s milk,
sweetened with sugar, honey, cow’s ghee or a mixture of both milk and ghee. ( Ghee is
prepared by heating the butter to remove the fat-insoluble, proteinaceous and other
matters and water, so that only fatty acids and the constituents soluble in fat are left.
It is surprising to ﬁnd that though butter has been a common household item in
India since ancient times, it has rarely been used for the administration of Ayurvedic
preparations.)
The other methods of administration of powdered herbs are infusion, decoction and
distillation. To make an infusion, the herb is immersed in water, usually kept overnight, ﬁltered and used. In decoction the herb is boiled in water until the water is
reduced to half or so, ﬁltered through a cheese cloth and heated further until the
decoction is reduced to one-fourth. The infusion or decoction may be used in place
of juice, if fresh herbs are not available. For distillation, fresh leaves or ﬂowers, dry root
or seed are boiled in water in a closed container and the steam that arises is condensed,
so that the volatile active constituents of the herb are dispersed in water (aqua).
Ghansatva are concentrated, sometimes standardized aqueous extracts of the herbs
made from the decoction in the form of a thick paste or dry powder. These are now
preferred by the pharmaceutical industry because they reduce the bulk of the herbs,
and can be easily incorporated into capsules or pills, are easy to formulate, have a
longer shelf life and the end products have good consumer appeal. Sometimes syrups
or alcoholic preparations are made from these extracts.
The herbal products, in general, have an expiry period of one year but if stored in
airtight containers they may be used for up to two years, whilst the mineral products
may be used indeﬁnitely. The early Ayurvedic physicians were aware that the aqueous
decoctions did not extract all the constituents from the herbs, so they developed
methods to generate alcohol from the solvent during fermentation, in which ethanol
soluble constituents of the herbal mixtures could be dissolved. These preparations are
called Asav and Arishta, to which sweetening agents such as raw sugar, honey and

14

Rasayana preparations

ﬂowers of Woodfordia ﬂoribunda, etc., which can be fermented easily, are initially added.
Due to the alcohol these preparations have a long shelf life, taste good and provide
immediate energy and therapeutic agent to the body. Asava and Arishta differ in their
method of preparation. Arishta are prepared from the decoctions of the herbs, whereas
Asav are made from dry powders. In both cases all the herbs are allowed to ferment in
airtight earthen pitchers for 40–50 days. Before the fermentation of herbal materials it
is ensured that the pots are clean. They are then fumigated with camphor, sandal and
agar wood (Aquillaria agallocha), or with long pepper powder and ghee. The water to be
used should not be alkaline and should be free of inorganic matter. When the period
of fermentation is complete, the solution is ﬁltered and stored in bottles. The fermented end product mainly consists of ethanol, glycerol, lactic acid, acetic acid,
besides other products. This can be used for an indeﬁnite period. In a study of
Draksharishta, it was seen that before fermentation the mixture contained 34.91 per
cent sugar, but after fermentation the product had 19.17 per cent sugar, 8.70 per cent,
alcohol, 0.24 per cent glycerin, 0.21 per cent lactic acid and 1.38 per cent acetic acid.
The pH of the medium changed from 6.40 to 5.00.
Avleha or lehya (linctus) are semi-solid preparations prepared from dry powders,
decoctions and the pulp of the herbs, along with sugary substances, honey, ghee and/or
oil. During preparation, sugar is boiled in the extract/decoction of the herbs or water,
until thick in consistency. A ﬁne powder of herbs, minerals and spices is then added
to warm thick syrup and stirred so that a homogenous mixture is formed, followed
by ghee or oil when still hot. Honey should be added after cooling the preparation.
Avleha should be dried to such an extent that there is neither too little nor too much
moisture.
The term Bhasam literally means ash. In practice, in this case, minerals, gems or
hard animal products, after treatment with herbs, are calcined at a very high temperature
to form ash and then this ash-like end product is heated and powdered repeatedly.
When this process has been repeated 100 times, the bhasam is known as Shatputi
(shat is hundred) but after 1,000 times it is known as Sahastraputi (sahastr is thousand).
For each mineral or exoskeleton of animals, different methods are followed. These
products do not degrade during storage and can be used indeﬁnitely.
Ghrita or Ghritam are preparations made from oil or ghee. These contain fat soluble
constituents. Ghrita are prepared by heating juice, paste, decoction, infusion, etc. of
the herbs in ghee and oil until all the water evaporates. The resulting mass is ﬁltered to
remove fat insoluble materials. The fat is preserved for use as a medicine. Where
vegetable oils alone are used, heating is stopped when froth appears, but when ghee is
used, heating is stopped when the froth subsides. For internal uses these preparations
can be stored for sixteen months after manufacture, but for external use there is no
expiry period.
Pak are the preparations made from milk, ghee, dry fruits, herbs, minerals and
spices. These preparations are mainly used as nutrients or aphrodisiacs. The usual
method for their preparation is to boil milk until thick and solid. This condensed
milk is fried in ghee and sugar powder or thick sugar syrup, herbs, minerals, chopped
dry fruits and spices, etc. are added to it when warm. The whole mass is made into
chocolate or candy balls of about 25 g each.
Before use poisonous herbs or minerals are subjected to mitigation called marn
(to kill) or sodhana to purify but it is actually a process to reduce the toxicity so as to
make them available to the body within safe therapeutic doses.

Rasayana preparations 15
In this process toxic materials are generally boiled or treated with some herbs or
chemicals in ﬂuids such as cow’s urine, cow dung solution, water, milk, etc. After
treatment the herb/mineral is dried and processed further before use.
In India, cane sugar juice is used for making raw sugar (brownish in colour) and for
sugar manufactured by western technology. In addition to these, an indigenous method
of reﬁning sugar has been used for a very long time. The end product, called Mishri,
consists of lumps of transparent, bold crystals. This sugar candy is considered to have
a cooling effect and is used in auspicious ceremonies and in Ayurvedic medicaments
as a sweetening agent. In the present book, the term sugar candy has been used for
Mishri, to differentiate it from other forms of sugar.
In Ayurveda ﬁve types of salts are recognised. Out of these a man-made preparation
called black salt is considered a good carminative and is included in many formulations
for digestive problems. It is prepared by fusing saltpetre (nitre), Terminalia chebula,
and common salt. In the presence of organic matter at high temperatures the salt turns
into a deep violet amorphous mass.

Calotropis procera (Ait.) R.Br.
C. gigantea (L.) R. Br. ex Ait.
Family: Asclepiadaceae
THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
Both Calotropis species are common, wild, latex-containing shrubs, growing on wasteland in the arid zones of India. The plants are characterized by thick leathery leaves,
with white incrustation. In C. procera (Fig. 1A) leaves are 5.5 to 15 cm long and
4 to 8 cm broad, ovate or oblong with acuminate apex. In C. gigantea (Fig. 1B)
the leaves are 10–20 cm long and 8–10 cm broad, obovate to oblong with a cordate
base. Flowers are white or pink in colour. The fruit is a follicle and seed is with
pappus.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda, two types of aak have been recognised, one with white ﬂower (C. procera)
and the other with red ﬂower (C. gigantea). Root (Fig. 1C), latex, and the ﬂower of
both species are used in medicine. These herbs are said to have a strong mercury-like
action on the human body, so these plants are often referred to as vegetable mercury.
The root bark occurs in irregular short pieces, slightly quilled or curved, externally
greyish yellow, soft and spongy, internally yellowish white. The taste is acrid and
bitter.
Root bark is alterative, tonic, antispasmodic, expectorant, and in large doses an
emetic. It has a Digitalis-like effect on the heart. It is used as a substitute of ipecacuanha
for inducing vomit. It also helps in dysentery. It increases glandular secretion, especially bile. For syphilis, it is smoked like tobacco. It is used as an antimicrobial agent
and is said to be as effective as mercurial preparations. The latex is applied externally
for chronic skin diseases such as leprosy and eczema.

Ayurvedic preparation
An aphrodisiac is prepared by pulverising a mixture of 125 dry ﬂowers and 12 g each
of clove, nutmeg, mace, and Anacyclus pyrethrum root. To use, 500 mg of this preparation is stirred in milk and administered three times a day (Nadkarni, 1954).

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

In diarrhoea and dysentery
The root bark powder, within the ﬁrst day of the treatment of diarrhoea, changed the
faecal matter into a semi-solid mass. In dysentery cases, mucus and tenesmus were
relieved. The bark was not effective when dysentery was accompanied by blood ( Jain
et al. 1985).

In migraine headaches
In the morning, before sunrise, tender leaves were given in a capsule with water on an
empty stomach. After treatment for three days, all patients suffering from migraine
headaches got relief (Prasad, 1987).

Hepatoprotective effect
Basu et al. (1992) tried chloroform root extract of C. procera in experimentally-induced
acute and chronic liver injury by carbon tetrachloride.

18

Aak

In inﬂammations
A single dose of the aqueous suspension of the dried latex was effective to a signiﬁcant
level against the acute inﬂammatory response (Kumar and Basu, 1994).

In bronchial asthma
Sharma and Sharma (1992) tried powders of both C. procera and C. gigantea on 75
patients of bronchial asthma, and observed good results. In another experiment, equal
quantities of C. gigantea, Piper nigrum and P. betle leaf juice were made into pills of 200
mg each. They were quite effective in the cases of asthma (Thirunavukkarasu, 1995).

Cytotoxic effect (anticancerous property)
On the basis of Ayurvedic principles, out of 500 plants, Smit et al. (1995) selected
forty four plants, which were supposed to have anticancerous properties. Of these
fourteen plants out were investigated for cytotoxicity on human colorectal carcinoma
cell line. Extracts of C. procera ﬂowers displayed the strongest cytotoxic activity.

Chemical studies
The herb juice is reported to contain calactin, calotropin, calotoxin and uscharidin, all
of which are poisonous in nature (Chouhan et al. 1992). In latex, a powerful bacteriolytic
enzyme, a very toxic glycoside calactin and a non-toxic proteolytic enzyme calotropin
have been identiﬁed. It is more proteolytic than papain and bromelain (Himalaya Drug
Co-Herbal database).

Toxicological studies
The accidental instillation of herb juice of both C. procera and C. gigantea resulted in
local poisoning (Chouhan et al. 1992). In higher doses, root bark caused nausea, vomiting
and diarrhoea, headache, burning micturition, and leucorrhea. The toxic constituents
of latex had a caustic effect on mucous membranes and tender skin. It increased heart
beat and respiration, leading to distress and death. Calotropin, a compound in latex, is
more toxic than strychnine (Himalaya Drug Co. – Herbal database).

Akrakara

Anacyclus pyrethrum DC
Syn: A. pyrethrum (L.) Lagsca
Family: Asteraceae (Compositae)
The English name of this root is pellitory. In Germany, A. ofﬁcinarum, also known as
A. pyrethrum or Pyrethrum germanicum was used earlier.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The plant does not grow in India, and is imported mainly from Spain, Algeria,
Morocco and other Mediterranean countries. It is commonly adulterated with other
roots of similar shape. It is a perennial plant, the stems of which in the earlier stages
lie prostate on the ground before arising erect. The leaves are smooth, alternate and
pinnate with deeply cut segments. Each stem bears one large ﬂower head; the disk
ﬂowers are yellow and ray ﬂowers white, tinged with purple beneath.
The root is slightly twisted, cylindrical, tapering brownish to greyish brown in
colour, wrinkled, about 0.5 cm thick, with a tuft of grey hairs and bright black spots.
The fracture is short and horny. The cut surface is pale white in colour and shows a
radiate structure in the centre, with many oleoresin glands in the bark. The root has
slight odour, taste is pungent with a tingling sensation.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Earlier, it was used in Europe for relieving toothache and in promoting free ﬂow of
saliva in cases of mouth and throat dryness. A gargle of the infusion was prescribed for
relaxing mouth muscles and in partial paralysis of the tongue. Patients seeking relief
from rheumatic or neuralgic affections of the head and face were advised to chew the
root daily for several months. It was supposed to purge the brain (cerebral stimulant)
and thus help in epilepsy, gout, sciatica and in lethargy (ﬁbromyalgia).
In India, because of its powerful irritant nature, it is considered a stimulant for the
nervous system and is included in the preparations used as a sex stimulant. It is also an
ingredient in recipes for paralysis, hemiplegia, chorea and rheumatism.
In Unani system of medicine, a decoction obtained by boiling in 100 ml of water,
a mixture of Anancyclus pyrethrum 2 g, ginger 1 g, liquorice 2 g is prescribed for 30–
45 days in facial palsy.

Phyllanthus emblica L.
Syn: Emblica ofﬁcinalis Gaertn
Family: Euphorbiaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The tree grows wild in the deciduous the forests of the Indian subcontinent and along
the foothills of the Himalayas. It ﬂowers in March to May and the fruit ripens in
the cold season. Leaves are feathery, with small, oblong, pinnately arranged leaﬂets
(Fig. 2A). The fruits are depressed globes (Fig. 2B). The fruit of the wild variety is the
smallest, 2–2.5 cm in diameter and 7–10 g in weight. This fruit has more ﬁbres, is
astringent and is more acidic in taste. Amla is often cultivated and two horticultural
varieties Biju and Kalmi are well known. In Biju variety the fruits are ﬂeshy globes,
2.5–3.6 cm in diameter weighing 10–15 g. The Kalmi variety has the biggest fruit,
which may grow up to 5 cm in size. The fresh fruit is waxy and when ripe its pale
yellow colour is often tinged with pink. The dry fruit (Fig. 2C) is smaller in size, subhexagonal and wrinkled. The colour varies from greyish black to yellowish brown,
depending on the stage of ripening when it is harvested. The dry fruit separates easily
into six parts and on applying pressure releases trigonous seed. Sometimes the commercial samples of the fruit are waxy brownish. These are obtained by drying the
boiled fruit. By boiling, the contents of the fruits gelatinize, resulting in a waxy pulp.
Morton (1957) has given an account of this tree.
In Ayurveda, the various characteristics of the fruit described are: Shreephala – fruit
of prosperity, Shiva – auspicious, nectar, Divyadhara – the basis of divine quality,
Sayastha – arrests old age, Dhatri – mother like, sustains the life, Vrishya – invigorating, Shitphal – fruit cooling in effect.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
According to Ayurveda, amalaki is sour but not acidic like other fruits. It is astringent
but sweet. On tasting the fruit, it is initially sour, but sometimes with a sweet
aftertaste, which becomes more apparent if water is drunk afterwards.
The common uses of the fruit are:

Amalaki

23

Figure 2 Phyllanthus emblica A leaves, B fresh fruit, C dry fruit.

As a Rasayana
Amalaki is considered best among Rasayana so called Acharasayana. It clears all the
three doshas present in the human body. A regular use of amalaki is presumed to
prolong lifespans, up to 120 years for humans. Its use not only increases human life
but also improves the quality. It imparts memory, balanced intellect, health, youthfulness, lustrous body and a clear voice. It helps reduce tendencies for headaches,
confusion of thought, psychic disorders and memory loss. Amla, when administered
with ghee, honey and oil for one month, is a geriatric tonic for general debility, lack of
disease resistance and memory loss. It overcomes the degenerative effects of old age. In
winter, when vitality is low, amla with ashwagandha, ghee and honey is restorative and
invigorating.

24

Amalaki

In stomach troubles
A decoction of the fruit is useful in dyspepsia, chronic dysentery and diarrhea. It is
cooling and a refrigerant, diuretic and laxative. A sherbet of the fruit made with
lemon juice helps acute dysentery, constipation, piles, enlarged liver and dropsy.

As an expectorant
It is a stimulant and expectorant in chronic bronchitis.

In diabetes
It is used for sugar control in diabetes. A tablespoon of the juice with a cup of bitter
gourd (Momordica charantia) juice, or with equal quantities of powder of seed kernel of
Syzgium cumini, taken daily for two months stimulates the pancreas and causes insulin
secretion.

In eye diseases
The eyes should be washed with a solution of amla juice. The juice is administered
internally with honey. It is said to restore eyesight and reduce intraocular tension.

As a hair tonic
As a hair tonic, for hair growth and pigmentation, hair is washed with an infusion
prepared by soaking amla overnight in water. For detergency, soap pod (Acacia concinna)
and soap nut (Sapindus mukorossi) may be added to amla before soaking. A hair oil is
prepared by boiling a decoction or juice of amla in the sesame oil until all water from
the mixture evaporates. While preparing this medicated oil, Centella asiatica, Eclipta
alba and some aromatic herbs may be used along with it.

Household preparations
Amla is a household remedy in many parts of India and may be used as follows:
Powder
The ﬁne powder of the fruit is administered as such, or with water or milk.
Decoction
The powder in the form of decoction and may be administered as such, or used as a
washing agent as detailed above.
Poultice
The coarse powder is heated with water and applied to wounds or swellings.

Amalaki

25

Medicated hair oil
As detailed above under hair tonic.
Medicated ghee
The juice or decoction of amalaki is boiled along with other herbs in butter oil (ghee)
until all the water evaporates.
Preserve
The big Kalami Amla (horticultural variety) fruit is stored in saline water for a couple
of days, washed, pierced with stainless steel needles and stored in a glass pot with
alternate layers of sugar and fruit. After a few days the sugar (which turns into syrup)
is separated from the fruits, heated until thick and poured back on the fruits. After
many days the sugar inﬁltrates the fruit, which becomes soft and loses much of
its astringency and sourness. This preserve is often administered with silver foil
for headaches, as a nervous tonic. While making the preserve, precautions are taken
to prevent iron objects from touching the amalaki fruits as these turn the preserve
black.

Compound Ayurvedic preparations
Amla is an ingredient of a large number of Ayurvedic preparations. The important
ones, in which amla is the main ingredient are: Amalaki Rasayana, Triphala, and
Chavanprasha. Keeping in view the importance and popularity of these products, a
detailed account of these is given after the therapeutic and pharmacology studies on
amla.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Bordi et al. (1985) have written a article on the juice of this fruit.

As an anabolic agent
It raised the total protein level and increased the body weight. Clinical research has
shown the positive effects of this fruit on the body, which include enhanced cellular
regeneration, increased lean body mass, enhanced production and secretion of interferon and corticosteroids. Amla preparation caused a signiﬁcant increase in body weight.
Nitrogen balance studies also showed that it has an anabolic effect (Singh and Guru,
1975, Tewari et al. 1968).

Antiemetic
This effect was observed by Yaqueenuddin et al. (1990).

26

Amalaki

Antioxidant effect
Experiments conducted at Niwa Institute of Immunology in Japan have shown it to
be a potent scavenger of free radicals as it has a high level of superoxide dimutase
(SOD) activity (Treadway, 1988). Earlier it was considered that the fruit’s antioxidant
activity was due to ascorbic acid, but work done by Thresiamma et al. (1996) and
Ghoshal et al. (1996) indicated that it is due to ellagic acid and four hydrolyzable
tannins.

As an antidiarrhoeal
The antidiarrhoeal activity is generally attributed to the astringent action of tannins in
the fruit on the mucosal proteins, resulting in the formation of a protective layer and
thus the arresting of intestinal inﬂammation.

As an antimicrobial
It has antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal activity. When Amla was studied
for inhibitory effects on human immunodeﬁciency virus-1 reverse transcriptase,
it exhibited signiﬁcant activity. Bioassay-guided studies indicated that putranjivain A and four other compounds are potent inhibitory substances (El-Mekkawy,
1995).

Antimutagenic effect
It protected Salmonella typhimurium against nitro-o-phenylenediamine-induced mutagensis (Grover and Simran Kaur, 1989).

As an immunomodulator
Amla has been found to enhance natural killer cell activity and antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity. It elicited a twofold increase in spleen NK cell activity on third
day of tumour inoculation, which became highly signiﬁcant later on. It increased the
lifespan of tumour-bearing rats by 35 per cent. The anti-tumour property is due to
cell mediated toxicity (Suresh and Vasudevan, 1994).

As a cytoprotectant
When animals fed with lead and aluminium salts were given aqueous extract of amla,
histopathological studies revealed that amla could prevent the cytotoxicity of metals
more successfully than vitamin C (Roy et al. 1991). Crude amla extract before administration of cesium chloride reduced the clastogenic effect of the compound in vivo on
mouse bone marrow. It reduced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (Ghosh
et al. 1993). Gulati et al. (1995) observed that 50 per cent alcohol extract and quercetin isolated from alcohol extract showed signiﬁcant hepatoprotection against alcohol
and paracetamol in rats. Ellagic acid from amla afforded protection against radiationinduced toxicity (Thresiamma et al. 1996).

Amalaki

27

As a nutritive tonic
Earlier the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the amla was considered to be due to the presence of
vitamin C in the fruit (Siddique and Ahmed, 1985). It was observed that one fruit of
amla contained vitamin C equivalent to nine oranges. Recent studies also conﬁrmed
that bioavailability of vitamin C from amla fruit is better than that from the synthetic
ascorbic acid, probably due to the presence of some accessory factors in the fruit. Roy
et al. (1987) observed that 10 ml of Amla syrup, containing 8.7 mg of vitamin C was
as effective as 100 mg of synthetic vitamin C. It is one of the fruits containing
chromium and some of the beneﬁcial effects of it may be due to this element ( Janjua,
1991). Amla preparations showed good effects in generalised weakness ( Jayaram et al.
1993).

In acne vulgaris
When Sunder vati (consisting of Holarrhena pubescens, Emblica ofﬁcinalis, Embelia ribes
and Zingiber ofﬁcinale) was studied in a double blind randomized placebo-controlled
clinical evaluation, a signiﬁcant reduction in lesions was indicated (Pranjpe and Kulkarni,
1995).

In heart problems
The effect of alcoholic extract of amla was studied on myocardial necrosis. It increased
the cardiac glycogen level signiﬁcantly with marked changes in serum-free fatty acids
levels. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyuruvate
transminase (SGPT), and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were signiﬁcantly less in
the group treated with this fruit (Tariq et al. 1977).

In hyperacidity
Cases of hyperchlorhydria with burning sensation in the abdomen, cardiac and gastric
regions beneﬁted from application of the fruit powder. A decoction prepared by taking
5 g amla in 80 ml of water (reduced to 20 ml) was given after main meals to patients.
There was signiﬁcant relief in symptoms after 30 days (Tripathi et al. 1992). When
water extract of amla was administered to patients of hyperhidrosis, excellent results
were achieved in 29 of 40 cases (Zachariah, 1984).

In hypercholesterolaemia
In a trial, when 15 g of fresh amla was taken daily for four weeks, it reduced cholesterol by 21 per cent. Feeding amla to hypercholesterolaemic rabbits for 12 weeks
increased lipid mobilization, catabolism and retardation of lipid deposition in the
extra hepatic tissues. The lipid level in the aorta increased but it was much less
compared with the control (Mand et al. 1991). Amla reduced serum cholesterol levels
signiﬁcantly and had an antiatherogenic effect. It was conﬁrmed that this effect of amla
is due to a group of compounds and not vitamin C alone (Thakur and Mandal, 1984).
Mathur et al. (1996) studied the hypolipidaemic effect of fruit juice in cholesterol-fed

28

Amalaki

rabbits and an antiatherosclerotic effect was observed. It lowered serum cholesterol,
triglyceride, phospholipid and LDL value by 82 per cent, 66 per cent, 77 per cent, and
90 per cent respectively. Rabbits treated with amla juice excreted more cholesterol and
phospholipids, suggesting that the juice changed the mode by which these compounds
are absorbed.

In leucorrhoea
A one g dose of equal quantities of amla and guggal with honey, three times a day was
effective in leucorrhoea (Seshagiri Rao et al. 1985). Triphala, when used, was also
effective (Singh and Londhe, 1993).

In ulcers
When the patients of duodenal ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia, were administered
amla, they showed improvements, with a signiﬁcant drop in acid and pepsin secretion
(Varma et al. 1977, Chawla et al. 1982). Complete radiological recovery was reported
in the peptic ulcer patients. Amla exhibited prophylactic affect against histamineinduced ulcers in albino rats (Singh and Singh, 1985). Intraperitoneal administration
of ellagic acid from amla, in a 5 mg/kg dose, markedly reduced the occurrence of
gastric lesion and acid secretion-induced stress (Murakami et al. 1991). Pakrashi and
Bandyopadhyaya (1996–1997) have also studied the effects of amla extract on peptic
ulcers.
AYURVEDIC PREPARATIONS

1 Triphala
This Rasayana is made by pulverizing a mixture of dry fruits of P. emblica, Terminalia
bellirica and T. chebula. Different opinions exist about the proportion of each fruit in
the formulation of Triphala. The various views are as follows:
1
2
3
4

One part each of the three fruits, by weight.
One part T. chebula, two parts T. bellirica and three parts P. emblica, by weight.
One part T. chebula, two parts T. bellirica and four parts P. emblica, by weight.
One fruit of T. chebula, two of T. bellirica and four fruits of P. emblica, by number.
(This does not appear appropriate as the weight of individual fruit on the same
tree varies and the resultant product based on the number of fruits cannot be of
uniform quality).

Uses in Ayurveda
Triphala is one of the most widely used Ayurvedic preparations and a household name
in India. It is a ﬁne combination of three Rasayana fruits, which interact and potentiate
each other. As with the Ayurvedic concept, it destroys kapha and pitta. It is a laxative,
digestive, carminative, good for eyes and gives relief in diabetes, leprosy and in chronic
fevers. The other major uses of Triphala are:

Amalaki

29

For arthritis
Boil 10 g Triphala in 200 ml of water until reduced to one-fourth and add one
teaspoon of honey to this decoction. Drink this decoction twice daily, in the morning
and evening. It is an anti-inﬂammatory agent and induces sleep.
As a blood puriﬁer
For healthy skin and in diabetes, take 3 g Triphala, 3 g turmeric, and 6 g sugar. Drink
this mixture with water for 60 days.
For chronic headaches
Take 30 g of Triphala and 10 g each of Swertia spp., turmeric, Azadirachta indica bark
and Tinospora spp. Make a ﬁne homogenous mixture. Take 10 g of this powder and
boil it in 800 ml of water until reduced to 200 ml, strain and drink along with 10 g
of Commiphora wightii gum.
In convalescence
Mix equal quantities of ﬁne powders of Triphala, Withania somnifera, Glycyrrhiza glabra
and Asparagus racemosus. The dose is 3 g with honey, before meals for 30– 40 days.
For improving eyesight and coughs
Make an infusion of 10 g Triphala in 400 ml of water and keep overnight. In the
morning ﬁlter the infusion and wash the eyes with it (it may cause irritation to eyes).
Internally, take 10 g Triphala with one teaspoon of ghee.
For obesity
Regularly drink two teaspoons of honey with one teaspoon of Triphala and a glass of
cold water.
For oral hygiene
As a tooth powder for dental cavities, spongy, bleeding gums and malodour, etc.,
make a ﬁne powder by mixing Triphala, Acacia bark and Butea gum 50 g each, ginger
and black pepper 10 g each, dehydrated alum (alum is heated to remove water until it
swells), common salt, turmeric, Cyperus scariosus, Embelia ribes, Azadirachta leaves and
Quercus gall (20 g each). Pass the powder through a sieve of 100 mesh or so, so that
there are no coarse or gritty particles. Massage this powder on the gum, not on the
teeth. Let the powder remain there for about 20 minutes. If there is an excess of saliva
in the mouth, it should be spat out but water for gargling should not be used during
the duration of treatment. The mouth may be rinsed afterwards.
(Note: this powder contains quite a number of astringent substances, some of
them very rich in tannins, so the mouth may become very dry after its use in some
cases.)

30

For premature grey hairs
Drink a mixture of two teaspoons of honey, half a teaspoon ghee and one teaspoon of
Triphala ﬁrst thing in the morning, when stomach is empty.
For stomach troubles
For indigestion A mixture of ﬁne powders of Triphala 10 g, black salt 1 g, divided
into three doses, is used three times a day.
As a laxative Boil 20 g Triphala in 400 ml of water until reduced to 100 ml. Add
10–20 ml of castor oil and drink before retiring. It is a very good colon cleanser.
For ﬂatulence Mix ﬁne powders of Triphala 15 g, raw sugar 10 g, ginger 5 g, and take
a dose of 5 g twice daily.
For loose motions with mucus a) Take 3 g Triphala with honey or b) a mixture of
equal parts of Triphala, Cyperus scariosus, Aconitum heterophyllum. Dose 3 g twice daily.
Avoid fried, spicy and hard-to-digest food items. (Note: A. heterophyllum is a nonpoisonous aconite, bitter in taste. It does not contain the toxic aconitine group of
alkaloids and is safe even for infants, to whom it is often prescribed as an antidote to
poisons.)

Therapeutic indications and pharmacological studies on Triphala preparations
Anthelmintic activity
Gaind et al. (1964) noted this activity.
As an anti-oxidant
Vani et al. (1997) observed radical scavenging properties in Triphala extract. It was
effective in preventing superoxide-induced haemolysis of red blood cells. The extract
also prevented lipid peroxidation in rat liver mitochondria.
Anti-inﬂammatory, analgesic and antipyretic property
Ghosh et al. (1989) observed these activities in Triphala. Doiphode (1993) prescribed
Sooksham Triphala to 73 patients suffering from fevers, headaches, body aches and
coughs. Out of these 49 patients showed signs of improvement.
As an antidiabetic
Triphala (90 mg/kg orally) had a signiﬁcant hypoglycaemic activity in fasting rats
(Ghosh et al., 1990).
In obesity
For weight loss, Pranjape et al. (1990) prescribed 250 mg Triphala guggal, three times
daily with lukewarm water before meals for three months. Kulkarni (1995a, b, c) used
Sooksham Triphala in obesity and observed a signiﬁcant weight loss with reductions in

32

Amalaki

skin-fold thickness, hip and waist circumference, serum cholesterol and triglyceride
levels. It was moderately useful in lipoma.
In leucorrhoea
Triphala decoction yielded good results, when given to the patients with symptoms of
leucorrhoea (Singh and Londhe, 1993).

2 Amalaki Rasayana I
Method Cut transversely into two pieces, one big and one small, the stem of mature
Butea tree. From one side of the bigger stem piece, scoop out wood to form a containerlike structure. With the smaller piece make a lid. Fill the container with fresh green amla
fruit and seal it with the lid. The whole assembly is covered on the outside with the
coarse cloth and plastered with wet clay about 2.5 cm thick. Heat the container in
slow burning cow dung cakes, remove it from the ﬁre after 2–3 hours and take out
the cooked fruits. Macerate these fruits by hand to remove the stones and ﬁbres from
the pulp. To this pulp add equal quantities of ghee and one and a half times as much
honey to form a paste.
Dose Before administering this preparation, Panchkarma is required and the patient is
conﬁned to a hut for one month. Water and food should not be used, only giving
cow’s milk 2–3 times a day. The initial dose of this Rasayana is 50 g, which may be
increased up to 200 g, depending on the digestive power of the patient.
Indications The above treatment is said to rejuvenate all body systems with increased
mental power, resistance and immunity. It is alleged to transform old men into young,
with new hair and teeth, and induce physical power like that of an elephant.

3 Amalaki Rasayana II
It is a simpler form of the above Amalaki Rasayana. It is prepared by blanching the
fresh fruit for ﬁve minutes in boiling water. When soft, stones and ﬁbres are removed
and the pulp of the fruit is dried in the sun. Add amla juice to this pulp, macerate and
dry. This process is repeated daily for 21 days. On the 22nd day store the completely
dry powder in an airtight container.
Dose: 2 g in the morning on an empty stomach with honey or with cold milk and
honey. Do not use hot milk with honey.
Amalaki Rasayana imparts positive nitrogen balance to the body. It is digestive,
laxative and diuretic (Singh and Guru, 1975).

4 Chavanprasha
It is also spelt as Cyavanaprasa, Chyavanprasha.
According to a legend in Rigveda, the sage Chavan got the formulation of this
supreme Rasayana for rejuvenation and longevity from the twin divine physicians

Amalaki

33

Ashwini Kumars and by using the formulation Chavan became young again. For the
beneﬁt of mankind he widely disseminated the knowledge about this preparation.
People in ancient India called it Chavanprasha Avleh ( prasha means diet, and avleh is
linctus), so its meaning is “the dietary linctus as revealed by Chavan”.
Due to the aggressive publicity of the commercial section, Chavanprasha has become
so popular in India that it accounts for one-third of the total sales of all Ayurvedic
products. It has been introduced in the western world with great success.
According to Ayurveda, as a dietary supplement it strengthens the organs under the
ribs. It is very effective in the convalescence of weak individuals, children and old
people suffering from coughs, colds, urinogenital problems and in all disturbances of
vata, pitta and virya (vital ﬂuid). It makes the body strong and lustrous, sharpens the
memory, contributing to a happy mind. The dose is 10–15 g in the morning and before
retiring in the evening. The dose can be increased or decreased as per the digestive
power of the patient.
Formulation of Chavanprasha
The formulation of Chavanprasha consists of two groups of herbs, Ashtvarga (eight
herbs) and Dashmul (ten roots), in addition to many other ingredients.
Ashtavarga
The plants of the Ashtvarga group became rare or extinct about 500 years ago.
The renowned author Bhavamisra (c1500–1600AD) suggested substitutes in his book
Bhavaprakasa Nighantu, as referenced by Chunekar and Pandey (1969). Bhavamisra
said, “What to say to common men is that as the herbs of Ashtvarga are not available
to kings even so the learned physicians should substitute the herbs of Ashtvarga by the
other herbs of the same physiological activity.” Bhavamisra suggested the following
substitutes for various members of Ashtavarga:
For Meda, Mahameda:
For Jeevak and Rishbhak:
For Kakoli and Ksheer Kakaoli:
For Ridhi and Vridhi:

Asparagus racemosus
Pueraria tuberosa
Withania somnifera
Dioscorea bulbifera, or Tacca aspera tubers.

Some other Ayurvedic experts did not agree with these substitutes and they suggested the following herbs:
In place of Jivak:
In place of Rishbhak:
In place of Meda:
In place of Mahameda:
In place of Kakoli:

Tinospora spp. or Centaurea behen
Orchis spp., or bamboo manna, or Salvia haematode
Orchis mascula
Paederia foetida, Asparagus adscendens
Curculigo orchioides

34

Amalaki
In place of Ksheer Kakaoli:
In place of Riddhi:
In place of Vridhi:

Chlorophytum arundinaceum or the other members of
white Musli
Sida spp. herb or seed
Orchis latifolia or Sida rhomboidea

Recent research workers, after extensive ethnobotanical surveys of the Himalayas,
from where Ashtavarga was probably collected, have identiﬁed the various members as
follows:

Ridhi Vridhi:
Jivak:
Rishbhak:
Kakoli:
Kshirkakaoli:
Meda, Mahameda:

Habenaria interemedia D. Don
Microstylis spp.
Microstylis wallichii Lindl.
Fritellaria oxypetala Royle
Lilium polyphyllum
Polygonatum verticillatum Moench.

Dashmul
These ten plants are further divided into two groups: laghu (herb) and Vrihta (tree
shrub).
Laghu This consists of Desmodium gangeticum, Uraria picta, Solanum indicum, S.
xanthocarpum, and Tribulus terrestris. These herbs grow mainly in the wild areas and
are handcrafted, which is tedious and uneconomical, so it is common practice to
use the whole herb with an admixture of adjoining ﬂora in place of genuine herb
roots.
Vrihat This includes Oroxylum indicum, Aegle marmelos, Gmelina arboreum, Clerodendrum
phlomoides, and Stereospermum suvaleons. The Ayurvedic texts mention the use of these
plants’ root bark but in these cases stem bark is used instead.
Recent studies on Dashmula by Gupta et al. (1983, 1984) have shown that its
decoction produced aspirin-like antipyretic and anti-inﬂammatory effects. It reduced
the spontaneous motor activity. It potentiated the pentobarbitone hypnosis and antagonized the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. It also exhibited tranquilizing,
sedative activity. The above research justiﬁed the use of Dashmula in pains, backache,
gout, sciatica, pyrexia, inﬂammation and oedema.
Composition of Chavanprasha
The composition of this product varies from place to place and from person to person.
The various manufacturers, on the basis of their experience, substitute the herbs with
some other herbs/materials or fortify the preparation with minerals, animal products,

Amalaki

35

etc. The number of formulations is so large that enumeration of the majority of these
will be beyond this book’s scope. For present purposes, as an example, a comparative
study of various ingredients in Charak Sanhita, Puri (1970), Alam (1977), Ayurvedic
Pharmacopoeia (personal communication) and by a commercial house, Baidyanath
(personal communication), is given in Table I.
It is commonly advocated that fresh amalaki fruit should be used for the preparation of Chavanprasha but Alam et al. (1977), on the basis of chemical analysis of the
end product, recommended the use of dry fruit also. These authors observed that
the product manufactured by cooking at a low heat for a longer duration is of better
quality than the product manufactured at a higher temperature. Earlier it was thought
that therapeutic efﬁcacy of Chavanprasha is due to vitamin C, but Alam et al. (1977)
could detect only 19 mg/100 g ascorbic acid from the product prepared at low temperatures from dry fruit and 17 mg/100 g from that of the fresh fruit. The product
obtained using a high temperature had 2.14 mg/100 g and the commercial samples
8.30 to 12.67 mg/100 g vitamin C. Shishoo et al. (1997) determined the vitamin C
contents of amalaki and Chavanprasha by sensitive 0-phenylenediamine ﬂuorometric
methods. The pericarp of a large variety of amla contained 2.915 mg/g, the smaller
variety 3.775 mg/g, the freeze-dried powder 23.24 mg/g and the room-temperature
dried powder 21.04 mg/g of vitamin C. None of the three market samples of Chavanprasha investigated contained any vitamin C, which probably gets destroyed during
processing.
Method of preparation Boil 1,000 amalaki fruits in a vessel containing 16 litres of
water. Crush 90 g of each of the herbs mentioned in Table I (except bamboo manna
and spices (cardamom, long pepper, cinnamon leaves, cinnamon, Mesua ferrea)) and tie
them loosely in a cloth to form a bag-like structure. Boil this bag in the vessel
containing amla fruits and 16 litres of water until the water is reduced to one-fourth.
When cool, the bag is taken out of water and discarded, while the amalaki fruit are
kept for making pulp. From the cooked fruits, seeds and ﬁbrous materials are separated by passing them through bamboo sieves or through thick ﬁlter cloth. The pulp
is fried in ghee and oil until dehydrated. A decoction of the herbs obtained above is
added to this fried paste and boiling is continued. When the mixture is like a thick
slurry, 4.50 kg sugar is mixed and heating is continued until a jam-like consistency is
obtained. The product is allowed to cool and 500 g honey, 352 g of ﬁne bamboo
manna powder, 175 g of ﬁnely powdered long pepper and all spices are added to the
end product.
A mechanical way of preparing Chavanprash is to crush blanched amalaki fruit to
form a paste. This paste is passed through a stainless steel sieve to remove nondigestible portions such as ﬁbres, the seed coat, etc. The paste is then heated with a
decoction of herbs. Pectin tests (as with jam) can be performed by treating the ﬁnished
product with alcohol or by dropping paste in a glass of water. Bearing in mind the
modern trend of using less fat, it has been shown that Chavanprasha made without
frying the pulp in oil or ghee does not deteriorate for many years if properly cooked.
Honey can be omitted in this preparation and sugar can be reduced. For diabetics
invert sugar may be used instead of cane sugar.
Alam et al. (1977) analysed various samples of Chavanprasha. The samples contained 22.29 to 27.70 per cent reducing sugars, 6.16–6.21 per cent non-reducing

36

Amalaki

sugars and 3.62– 4.13 per cent total fats. The genuine sample had 14.04–18.32 per
cent reducing sugars, 1.24–12.66 per cent non-reducing sugars and 2.19–7.67 per
cent fats. A commercial sample contained 68.9 per cent total sugars and 8.33 per cent
fats.
Dose 10–15 g in the morning and before retiring in the evening. If digestion is
impaired by its use and food intake is reduced, then decrease the dose as per the
digestive power of an individual.
Contraindications Polyurea, acidic urine, constipation, ﬂatulence, diarrhoea, and nocturnal spermatic emission.
Precaution Chavanprasha is often made more palatable by adding more sugar and
honey than that prescribed in ancient texts. Most of the commercial preparations
contain up to 570 g of sugar and 60 g honey in one kilogram of preparation, without
any warning for diabetics or individuals who are overweight or have high levels of
cholesterol.
Chavanprasha Special
Chavanprasha is often fortiﬁed with gold and silver foil, saffron, musk (this is now
mainly synthetic), red sulphide of mercury, stag horn or other ingredients which are
supposed to have an invigorating effect. One such formulation is as follows:
Ingredients 2 kg Chavanprasha avleh, 25 mg processed gold, 10 g processed tin, 2 g
saffron, 10 g stag horn ash, 10 g mica (processed 100 times), 2 g silver foils, 5 g
Makardhawaj (red sulphide of mercury).
Method Start with trituration of saffron, followed by other inorganic materials, one
by one, until the whole mass is homogenous. Mix this mass in Chavanprasha. If the
preparation is too thick and proper mixing is not possible add honey to lower the
viscosity.
Dose 5–10 g.
Uses It increases the aphrodisiac effect of Chavanprasha many times and stimulates all
the body systems. It should only be used in winter or in cold areas. It is said to have
a very strong heating effect on the body and so should not be used in hot areas or
during hot weather.
Therapeutic studies on Chavanprasha
It has an anabolic effect so is recommended for catabolic diseases like chronic infection, mainly pulmonary. Ojha et al. (1973) observed an increase in body weight
and a 24-hour retention of urinary and faecal nitrogen in experimental animals fed
on it. In other studies Varma et al. (1973) concluded that Chavanprasha toned up
cardiovascular and respiratory systems and improved metabolism, particularly protein metabolism, and decreased urinary nitrogen and creatine levels. It affected the
positive nitrogen balance. There were increases in serum protein levels, correcting the

Amalaki

37

albumin–globulin ratio. The secretion of urinary muco-polysaccharides and hydroxyproline decreased which suggested decreased connective tissue breakdown (this occurs
at a higher rate in old people). The decrease in acetylcholine and histamine suggested improved adrenocortical function. It toned testicular activity with a signiﬁcant
increase in urinary testosterone. It improved respiratory stress, induced improved
stress tolerance by correcting levels of neurohumours. Ojha et al. (1975) used Chavanprasha as an adjunct in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis; the clinical features
were chronic lung infection and malnutrition. It showed results comparable to those
of anabolic steroids, vitamins and protein supplements, with signiﬁcant increases
in body weight, without any side effects. When administered with antitubercular
drugs there was not only amelioration of symptoms but a relative quick therapeutic
response.
Savrikar and Bhangle (1984) carried out clinical studies with this preparation,
while Tersia et al. (1982) noted that Chavanprasha was effective in increasing the
body weight and haemoglobin levels considerably. Jose and Kuttan (1995) observed
that aqueous extract inhibited oxygen free radicals. It had an effect on potent inhibitors of lipid peroxide formation and acted as a scavenger of hydroxyl and superoxide
radicals in vitro. Mehrotra et al. (1995) noted adaptogenic and antifungal properties
in it.

Chemical studies
The fruit is very rich in vitamin C. The tannins of the fruit consist of gallic acid and
ellagic acid, which prevent the decomposition of vitamin C in both the raw form as
well as in the ﬁnished product (Brahamchari and Gupi, 1958). In another study,
analysis of the fruits collected in winter showed the following results: vitamin C 921
mg/100 ml in juice, 720/100 mg in pulp, calcium 0.05 per cent phosphorus 0.02 per
cent, iron 1.2 mg and nicotinic acid 0.2 mg.

* In addition to these, processed mica, ash of stag horn and red sulphide of mercury is also added.
** It is a sugar reﬁned in Ayurvedic way.
The original formulation in the ancient texts recommended higher quantities of Amalaki fruit but the end product if
prepared with this quantity is unpalatable, so the subsequent formulations contained lesser quantity of Amla and more
of sugar.

Anantmul

Hemidesmus indicus R. Br
Family: Asclepiadaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is also known as Indian Sarsaparilla. It should be distinguished from American
Sarsaparilla, Smilax aristolochaefolia Mill and Jamaican Sarsaparilla, Smilax ornata
Hook f.
It is a latex containing creeper (Fig. 3A) with opposing leaves that are 5–10 cm
long with white streaks. Flowers are in bunches, greenish from outside but violet from
inside. Follicles are 10 to 15 cm long. It grows in the sub-tropical forests of east and
south India. The root of anantmul is 1–2 cm thick, blackish brown and wrinkled on
the outside. The central woody portion is quite distinct (Fig. 3B). It has a pleasant
camphoraceous smell and a mild bitter, astringent taste. The active ingredients are
contained in the bark.
In Ayurveda, there is a confusion about the botanical identiﬁcation of another
herb sariva. Some authors think that H. indicus is white sariva (Karnick, 1977).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As per Ayurveda, it is cooling, sweet, anabolic, heavy, oily, bitter, aromatic laxative,
sudoriﬁc and a blood puriﬁer. It stimulates the ﬂow of bile and is antidote to
tridosha and body toxins. It helps in leucoderma, malodour from the body and
bronchial problems, leucorrhoea, gastroenteritis, inﬂammation, physical weakness,
fatigue, weight loss, threatened miscarriage and kidney stones. It cures skin diseases
and ulcerations, especially those of syphilitic origin. The other major uses of this
herb are:

Diuretic effect
The decoction of root increases urine output by three to four times. When used with
Tinospora spp. this herb’s effect is enhanced further.

44

In urino-genital problems
With Tinospora and cumin, it relieves inﬂammation of urethra and burning micturition.
The decoction of 3 g powder of the herb helps with prostate problems.

In sexually transmitted diseases
With Tinopspra spp., it is a valuable remedy for third and fourth stages of syphilis and
its numerous manifestations. It may be used as follows:

Anantmul 45

Give a decoction made from equal parts of Citrullus colocynthis root, anantmul,
Ichnocarpus, Hedyotis auriculata, to the patient as per the drinking capacity along
with long pepper and Commiphora wightii powder.
Pulverize 5 parts of anantmul, 4 parts of Vetiveria, 5 parts of Cyperus scariosus, 6
parts of Picrorhiza and 4 parts of ginger. Prescribe a dose of 5–10 g of this
preparation.

For infants and children
Hot infusion of the root with milk and sugar is a tonic for children with chronic
coughs and diarrhoea.

As a laxative
Make a paste of 25 g each of anantmul, Pavonia odorata, Cyperus rotundus, ginger and
Picrorhiza. Prescribe 10 g of this paste, twice daily with warm water.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
It suppressed both the cell mediated and humoral component of the immune system
(Atal et al. 1986).
The glycosides had an anti-tumour property (Deepak et al. 1997).

Chemical studies
The following compounds have been reported; coumarins, volatile oil, crystalline
principle hemidesmine (Nadakarni, 1954), two sterols–hemidesterol and hemidesmol
(Chunekar and Pandey, 1969) and pregnane glycoside (Deepak et al. 1997). The major
component of the essential oil has been identiﬁed as p-methoxy salicylic aldehyde.

Ashwagandha

Ashwagandha

Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal
Family: Solanaceae
It is also known as Indian ginseng.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The herb grows as a weed in the drier part of India on waste land. A cultivar is being
cultivated on a large scale in some parts of central India. The plant is an evergreen
shrub, 1–2 m high, with the whole body covered with star shaped hairs. Leaves
(Fig. 4A) are simple, petiolate, ovate, and glabrous. Flowers are inconspicuous, in
axillary clusters, light green or pale yellow, calyx membraneous. Berries are small,
globose, orange red when mature with numerous yellow reniform seed. In wild forms
the roots (Fig. 4B) are thick, ﬁbrous, brown to dark brown and may even get twisted
with age, with very little starch. However, in the cultivated plants, the root (Fig. 4C)
is pale white, cylindrical and starchy.
Four chemotypes of W. somnifera have been recognised so far within the plant’s
natural population. The biological activity of these cultivars varies signiﬁcantly and
their biochemical heterogenity has been established. The cultivated variety, which
probably originated near the town Nagaur in Rajasthan (India) and was hence known
as Asgandh Nagori, became popular because of the starchy nature of its root. Asgandh
Nagori is sown in the rainy season and the roots are ready for harvesting in winter.
There is a controversy about the botanical nature of this plant. Some authors are of
the opinion that it is a cultivated variety of Withania, while others identify it as a
distinct species, W. ashwagandha Kaul. Further details on this and other aspects of
Withania can be had from the book on this herb by Sandhya Singh and Sushil Kumar
(1998).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Since ancient times ashwagandha has been considered a nervine tonic, alterative, aphrodisiac, deobstruent (having the property of removing obstruction in any system of
the human body) and a sedative. It has been used in rheumatism, consumption and in
debility. The Indian name ashwagandha (ashwa- horse, gandha- smell), now commonly

Ashwagandha

47

Figure 4 Withania somnifera A twig, B dry root from wild plants, C dry root from
cultivated plants.

called asgandh or asgand, is due to the smell that arises from the fresh root. In Ayurvedic
texts, it is mentioned that this herb imparts the power and (sexual) strength of horse
to a man.
Ashwagandha can be used by persons of both sexes, of all ages and at all stages of
their lives. In elders it provides energy, relieves inﬂammations, pains and aches of the
back, hand and feet, and in the generative system, nervous debility and diseases due to

48

Ashwagandha

vata. It is being prescribed as an anabolic agent, as an adaptogen and analgesic for
the treatment of various arthropathies, certain forms of hypertension, insanity, etc. It
imparts resistance to infection and stress. It stimulates sexual impulses and increases
sperm counts. It is considered a Rasayana, for strength, vigour and for rejuvenation.
The easiest way to use the root is to take one teaspoonful of the ﬁne powder with
sweetened milk, or mix the powder with ghee, lick the mixture followed by milk
sweetened with sugar candy.
In gynecological practice it helps in sterility, leucorrhoea and inﬂammation of the
vagina. It also helps breast development. For these purposes, take one teaspoonful of
ashwagandha powder with half a teaspoonful of ghee, and honey before breakfast in the
morning and before sleeping in the evening, followed by cold sweet milk. It must be
taken for three months, particularly during winter.
Ayurvedic scholars consider the wild root to be a narcotic (the speciﬁc name somnifera
means sleep inducer which implies its sedative nature) which should be applied externally to inﬂammation, boils, pimples and as an ingredient of massage oils. For internal
consumption the wild root should be mitigated by boiling it in milk. Asgandh Nagori
can be used as such.
Some of the important recipes of ashwagandha are as follows:

As a Rasayana
Method Mix the powders of 100 g Withania, 50 g Tinospora, and 10 g of Tinospora
(see gaduchi) starch.
Dose Mix half a teaspoonful of this powder with half a teaspoon of ghee and two tea
spoons of honey. Drink with cold sweetened milk twice daily for sixty days.
For infants and children, as a nutritive tonic, boil 1–2 g of this powder in a cup of
milk, add to it 9–10 drops of ghee and give 1 teaspoonful of this warm milk to infants
and two teaspoons to children.
Use As a general tonic for all ages for vigour, vitality, nutrition, and stamina. It is a
good nutritive tonic for malnourished men. It helps male sexual inadequacies (impotence, premature ejaculation, partial erection of penis, inability to perform the sex act,
lack of libido and stamina, etc.).

For premature ejaculation
Pulverize 100 g each of Withania, Argyreia, Hygrophila, Glycyrrhiza and sugar candy.
Take 10 g of this mixture with honey, and drink with milk.

In azoospermia
It is alleged that too much sexual indulgence through masturbation and other perverted sexual actions may lead to the collapse of vital body systems. For a cure, take in
the morning on an empty stomach for 3– 4 months, one teaspoon of asgandh, half a
teaspoon of sugar candy, a quarter teaspoon of long pepper, half a teaspoon ghee and
one and a half teaspoons of honey, followed by 200 ml milk boiled with one teaspoon
of Withania, and one teaspoon of ghee.

Ashwagandha

During pregnancy
A decoction of 10 g aswagandha powder in a cup of water, when used for 2–3 months,
provides nutrition to both the mother and foetus.

In leucorrhoea
I Take one teaspoon of asgandh powder and sugar with warm water for 3– 4 months. It
not only cures the disease but strengthens the body.
II Mix the ﬁne powders of 100 g each of asgandh and vidhara, 20 g each of cardamom
and eggshell ash, 10 g of processed tin and 150 g of sugar candy. Take 3 g of this
powder, twice daily for four months.

For vata diseases
Due to indigestion and constipation, vata gets vitiated. For pacifying it, one tea
spoonful of Ashwagandhadi Ghrit can be administered with a glass of water or make a
mixture of equal quantities of Withania and Asparagus powders, with sugar candy.
Take one teaspoon of this with milk twice daily.

In sterility
If conception is not possible due to improper ovum development, women should be
prescribed 10 g Withania powder roasted in a small quantity of ghee on a low heat,
followed by boiling it in a glass of milk for 15–20 minutes. This preparation should
be taken for three days before and seven days after menstruation, freshly prepared and
warm, in the morning on an empty stomach. Continue this treatment every month,
until pregnant.

For sleeplessness
Take one teaspoon of Withania with ghee and honey every evening. If sleeplessness is
due to vata add 2 g of long pepper to the above mixture.

As a galactagogue
For increasing milk during lactation, make a ﬁne powder of equal quantities of Withania,
Asparagus, Pueraria tuberosa and liquorice. This powder is taken twice daily.
AYURVEDIC PREPARATIONS

Ashwagandhadi Churn
Method

Pulverize 100 g Withania root, 100 g Argyreia speciosa root.

Dose 5 g twice daily with sweet milk or moisten the powder with ghee (butter oil),
chew the mixture and swallow, followed by milk after 20 minutes or so. The powder
can be administered with water but milk is preferred.

50

Ashwagandha

Use A. speciosa fortiﬁes the effect of ashwagandha. It should be drunk with milk. This
churn strengthens physical, mental and sexual systems, particularly those of lean and
thin persons. It builds resistance against infection, helps sleeplessness, nervous breakdown, memory, wrinkles on the face and premature ageing.

A general tonic for all ages.

Ashwagandha Ghrit
Method Asgandh root, 500 g coarse powder and 100 g ﬁne powder, 250 g ghee, 1 litre
cow’s milk.
Method Boil coarse asgandha powder in 4 litres of water to obtain 1 litre of decoction.
Separately make a paste of ﬁne powder of aswagandha in water. Add this paste to the
ﬁltered decoction, followed by ghee, milk and heat until the fatty matter is free from
moisture.
Dose Half to one teaspoon with sugar candy and milk as per the digestive power of
an individual.
Indications Ashwagandha Ghrit is very beneﬁcial to infants (dose 3– 4 drops with
milk) and to children (dose 3 g to half teaspoon). It is highly nutritious. It makes the
body strong, sturdy and stimulates the nervous system. It gives strength, cures diseases due to vata, arthritis, back pain, weakness in any part of the body, sleeplessness,
sexual debility, depression, and nervous tension.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Psychotropic effects
It showed barbiturate hypnosis potentiation effect and a decrease in locomotive activity. It reduced the depletion of acetylcholine and catecholmine in the brain (Singh

Ashwagandha

51

et al. 1979). It affected drug-induced narcosis in female and male mice (Ahmuda et al.
1991b). The total alkaloids exhibited prolonged hypotensive, bradycardia, respiratory
stimulation, relaxant and antispasmodic effects, similar to papaverine, on intestinal,
uterine, bronchial, and vascular systems. In mice, these prolonged sleeping time,
as well as having a nicotenolytic effect. They increased the levels of serotonin and
histamine in brain tissue. The protective effect of asgandh extract against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) has been seen to induce convulsions in mice. This was dose dependent
(Kulkarni et al. 1993) and was comparable to diazepam in both chemical and electrical
kindling (Kulkarni and George, 1995) and against amygdaloid kindling (Kulkarni
et al. 1995). Root extract protected electrographic activity in a lithium-pilocarpine
model of status epilepticus. Acute pre-treatment with the extract enhanced the
antiepileptic effect of diazepam and clonazepam (Kulkarni et al. 1998).

As an anabolic agent
Ashwagandha increased body weight, total protein content and mean corpuscular haemoglobin in children. A weight promoting effect in young children was observed,
without any toxic effect, even after 8 months of continuous daily administration
(Venkatraghavan et al. 1984). This anabolic effect of Withania may be due to the fact
that:
1

It contains steroidal substances, which enhance liver glycogen.
It stimulates the appetite by exhibiting anti-serotonergic activity, like cyproheptidine, with maximum effect in children.
It reduces adenocortical activity and has a sedative effect.
The depressant action produced by this herb may reduce metabolic rate leading to
diminished calorie utilization and tendency towards weight gain. Ashwagandhafed animals showed a reduction of 1.5°C in body temperature, which signiﬁes
lower metabolic rate and underutilization of glycogen.
It promotes growth by enhancing the growth of tissue components, with and
without the release of growth hormones.
It increases liver weight, with no histopathological aberrations of cellular structures.

Immunomodulator activity
The important constituents of ashwagandha, withaferin A and withanolide D, induced
signiﬁcant immunosuppressive activity (Shobat et al. 1978). It was an immunomodulator
and chemoprotector against cyclophosphamide (Praveen Kumar et al. 1994, Davis and
Kuttan, 1998). It had the potential to alleviate the adverse effects of morphine and the
attendant immunodepression (Ramarao et al. 1995). A signiﬁcant modulation of
immune activity was observed in three animal models used. It prevented myelosuppression of mice treated with all three immunosuppresive drugs tested, with signiﬁcant
increase in haemolytic antibody response towards human erythrocytes (Ziauddin et al.
1996).

Anticancerous activity
Withania was able to arrest cell division, produce mitotic abnormality in metaphase block and chromosome breakage in tissue culture of tumours. Cells in the

52

Ashwagandha

resting stage were undamaged but the active cells degenerated. Withaferin A from
the root exhibited signiﬁcant retardation of tumour growth against sarcoma 180
and KB human carcinoma cells (Palyi et al. 1969). It also had antineoplastic activity. It prevented urethane-induced decreases in body weight, increased mortality
and induced lung adenomas in albino mice. Simultaneous oral administration of
asgandha in a dose of 200 mg/kg along with urethane protected the animals from
the tumour inducing effect of this compound (Singh et al. 1986). Budhiraja and
Sudhir (1987) also observed antitumour property from withanolides. Uma Devi
et al. (1992, 1993, 1996) tried alcohol extract of ashwagandha and withaferin A and
found that both had in vivo inhibitory effect on transplantable mouse tumour Sarcoma
180. Ganasoundri et al. (1997) and Sheena et al. (1998) conﬁrmed this research.
Dhuley (1997) studied the effect of W. somnifera on the function of the macrophages
obtained from the mice treated with the carcinogen ochratoxin A. The chemotactic activity of murine macrophages was signiﬁcantly decreased compared with the
control. Production of interlukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor was also markedly
reduced.

As an adjuvant to cancer therapy
Ashwagandha showed a radiosensitizing effect. It increased the effect of radiation on
tumour regression and delayed the growth of tumours. When it was administered for
ten days, with exposure to gamma radiation followed by hyperthermia, there was
a signiﬁcant increase in tumour cure (Uma Devi et al. 1993). A 75 per cent methanol
extract of the herb signiﬁcants increased the total blood cell count, bone marrow
cellularity and lymphocyte. Leucopenia, induced by sub-lethal dose of gamma radiation, was reduced. It normalized the ratio of norchromatic and polychromatic erythrocytes after radiation exposure (Anand and Kuttan, 1995; Kuttan, 1996). Beneﬁcial
effects were seen when this drug was given before and after radiation (Bhattathiri et al.
1995). Uma Devi (1996) and Uma Devi et al. (1996) conﬁrmed that withaferin is a
good, natural source of a safe radiosensitizing agent.

Antistress activity
Withania improved mental functions by reducing stress (Shukla, 1981) due to its mild
depressant action on the body. It induced a state of non-speciﬁc increase in resistance
during stress (Sankara Subramanian, 1982). This antistress activity is useful in the
prevention of stress-induced gastric ulcer, liver toxicity, leucocytosis, carcinoma,
leucopenia, and hypertension, etc. (Singh et al. 1982). It inﬂuenced the dopaminergic
system, which has been implicated in stress (Saksena et al. 1989). It was tried in 25
cases of depressive illness for two months. It showed notable symptomatic improvement,
decrease in degree of anxiety and depression (Singh and Murthy, 1989; Singh et al.
1990). The root extract which had CNS depressant properties showed an antianxiety
effect in the patients with anxiety neurosis (Gandhi, 1994). It helped in stress-induced
response from anxiety, depression, analgesia, thermic changes, gastric ulcers, convulsions, and restored stress-induced depletion of the adrenals and ascorbic acid (Sandhya
Singh and Sushil Kumar, 1998).
Looking into the central nervous system depressant action of this root, Pande and
Sharma, (1992) suggested its use as an anaesthesia.

Ashwagandha

53

Gandhi et al. (1995) tested anabolic activity and endurance time by feeding mice
with ginseng and ashwagandha. Both herbs were effective but ashwagandha had a
better weight gaining capacity.

In cervical spondylosis
Withania (4 g) and Smilax china decoction was tried on 25 radiological conﬁrmed cases
of cervical spondylosis for 30 days. This herbal combination was as effective as Brufen
and was without side effects (Shareef, 1993).

As an adaptogen
Singh (1982) studied the adaptogenic property of ashwagandha. It increased swimming
endurance in mice and prevented gastric ulcers-induced chemically by stress in rats.
Bhattacharya et al. (1987) isolated the compounds which were uniformly active in
attenuating stress-induced responses ranging from anxiety, depression, analgesia, thermic
changes, gastric ulcers, convulsions, tribulin activity and adrenocortical activation.
Roy et al. (1992a, b) and Srivastava (1995) studied the changes in the psychophysiological status of trainee mountaineers by altitude gain up to 7,000 m and then descending.
Ashwagandh, administered 500 mg daily, altered behaviour including sleep pattern,
alertness, state of awareness, along with other physical capabilities.

As a geriatric tonic
When studied for its effect on the ageing process in healthy male adults, it showed
signiﬁcant increases in haemoglobin count and hair melanin, with decreases in nail
calcium, serum cholesterol and erythrocyte sedimentation (Kuppurajan et al. 1980;
Ahmuda et al. 1991a, b). Bhattacharya et al. (1995) studied the effect of glycowithanolides on animal models of Alzheimer’s disease and perturbed central cholinergic
markers of cognition in rats. The effects validated its use as a promoter of learning and
memory.
Intake of a herbal capsule consisting of Withania, Tribulus and ginseng with milk
enhanced certain aspects of psychomotor performance. An increase in strength, viability process and endurance time was shown (Karnick, 1992).

As an antiulcerogenic agent
It had a signiﬁcant dose-dependent effect on aspirin-induced gastric ulcers. It reduced
the ulcer index and caused the healing of ulcers (Sahni and Srivastava, 1993, 1994).

As an antiinﬂammatory agent
Bector (1968) studied the role of ashwgandha on various types of arthritis. Immuno
electrophoresis studies revealed that this herb changed the concentration of various
serum proteins. A therapeutic dose of 100 mg/kg body weight showed 46 per cent
anti-inﬂammatory activity on paw volumes in rats (Anbalgan and Sadique, 1981a, b).
A compound withaferin A inhibited adjuvant arthritis (Bahr and Hansel, 1982).
Budhiraja et al. (1984) observed the marked effect of another compound from the root

54

Ashwagandha

in sub acute inﬂammation. A comparison showed it to be better than phenylbutazone
and hydrocortisone. Administration of Withania to inﬂamed rats caused a signiﬁcant
reduction in the level of alpha-2-macroglobulin and enhanced the synthesis of total
serum protein (Anbalagan and Sadique, 1985). Hazeena Begum and Sadique (1988)
studied long term effects of the herb on induced arthritis in rats. It prevented bodyweight loss during the arthritic conditions and reduced paw swellings during the
secondary lesions. Radiographic observations revealed that it prevented bone degeneration and compared well with hydrocortisone. Al-Hindawi et al. (1992), Sahni and
Srivastava (1994, 1995) and Nanshine et al. (1995) conﬁrmed anti-inﬂammatory effect
of this root.
Kulkarni et al. (1991, 1992) tried an Ayurvedic preparation containing Withania,
Boswellia and Curcuma. It relieved pain, morning stiffness, and caused a drop in erythrocyte sedimentation.

In skin problems
For keratitis and rough skin Gupta et al. (1994) prescribed Ashwagandha Rasayana,
by concentrating ashwagandha powder seven times with ashwagandha decoction until
completely dry and prescribed it in a dose 3 g twice daily. This preparation also
stopped female hair loss after childbirth.

In liver diseases
The protective effect of withanolides against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity is well known (Budhiraja et al. 1986). Some of the modern drugs are known
to cause hepatotoxicity. Ashwagandha can be an important adjuvant to these types
of chemicals (Chhajed et al. 1991). When used with long pepper, it produced marked
histopathological changes in induced hepatotoxicity. Withania, with other herbs,
acted as a free radical scavenging agent for pancreatic islets (Bhattacharya et al.
1997a).

As an antioxidant
Dhuley (1998) evaluated the effect of ashwagndha on lipid peroxidation in stressinduced animals. It prevented the rise in lipid peroxidation. This antioxidant activity
of glycowithanolids (sitoindosides VII-X, and withaferin A) was investigated for their
effects on rat brain. These withanolides had a dose-dependent effect. This antioxidant
effect may, at least in part, explain the antistress, immunomodulatory, cognitionfacilitating, anti-inﬂammatory and anti-ageing effects of this herb reported in earlier
studies (Bhattacharya et al. 1997b).
Sunanda Panda et al. (1997) investigated the effect of root extract containing 1.75
per cent withanolides in mice treated with cadmium chloride. Ashwagndha treatment
attenuated lipid peroxidation induced by cadmium.

Chemical studies
During the earlier studies Sankara Subramanian (1982) found that the total alkaloids
in the root are 0.13–0.32 per cent. Besides alkaloids, steroidal lactones under the

Ashwagandha

55

generic name, withanolides, have been reported. Chemical studies of the four chemotypes
of this plant showed that the main constituent of chemotype I is withaferin A, and
that of chemotype II withanolide D, chemotype III is characterized by the presence of
two groups of compounds: withanolide G & H and E & F. The chemotype IV is rich
in withaferin A and withanone.

Toxicological studies
When withaferin A was studied for acute toxicity, a single injection of 50 mg/kg body
weight did not cause any deaths. Higher doses of 100 mg/kg and above produced
diarrhoea and severe weight loss. A single intraperitoneal injection of 1,100 mg/kg
of the extract in mice did not cause any deaths within 24 hours. The LD50 value
was calculated as 1,260 mg/kg body weight. Sub acute toxicity studies with repeated
injections of extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 30 days, in rats of either
sex, did not result in any mortality or changes in peripheral blood constituents (Sharada
et al. 1993a, b). It was devoid of side effects even after 8 months of use.

10 Badam

Prunus amygdalus Batsch
Syn: Amygdalus communis L. var. dulce
Family: Rosaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a tree of the temperate zone with dry summers, naturalized in the Mediterranean
Basin and is cultivated in Kashmir (India) Baluchistan (Pakistan), Afghanistan, Iran,
Cyprus, Turkey, Spain and California (USA). According to Ayurvedic scholars almond
from Iran is the best and that from the USA is of the lowest quality.
The plant is a small tree, 5–6 m high, purplish bark, bright green leaves, pale pink
or white ﬂowers. The drupe fruit is ovate, 5 cm long and 2.5 cm broad. Its seed is
brown in colour, 17–15 mm long, 10–13 mm broad, oblong lanceolate and its brown
outer covering can be removed by soaking the seed in water.
Several varieties of almond are known but broadly it can be classiﬁed into two
varieties, bitter and sweet. Earlier there used to be occasional mixing of bitter almonds
with the sweet one but now it is rare. The bitter almond is poisonous and should be
used for external purposes only. Almond seed kernel is often adulterated with that of
apricot, but the two can be easily differentiated by the small size and different shape
of apricot kernel.
The seed should be stored, after completely drying them, to avoid the decomposition of amygdalin and ﬁxed oil. Adding a few cloves to storage bins of almond delays
this decomposition.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As per the Ayurvedic concept, dry fruits generally provide nutrition and vital energy
to the body. Out of all dry fruits, almond is said to provide maximum beneﬁt. It
suppresses pita and vata. It is oily and causes phlegm so it is harmful to the patients of
rakt pita. Almond should be consumed as per the digestive power of an individual.
During its consumption, if there is a loss of appetite or any other stomach trouble,
then the quantity of almonds should be reduced but it should not be stopped altogether. Do not use almond with honey and hot milk. If honey is to be used, use cold

60

Badam

milk. Almond kernel contains heat sensitive compounds so should not be heated while
making any of its preparations.
In India, almond is generally considered a nutritive for the brain and nervous
system. It is also said to improve eyesight. In a book on medical secrets of food, it is
mentioned that more than 10,000 Jain monks in Karnataka (India) attribute their
high intellectual level and longevity to the consumption of almond. As per their
concept, the longevity of an individual is neither due to a strong body nor an active
nervous system but due to thin sense ﬁbres (gyantantu) which arise from the brain and
pass through neck. Almond provides nutrition to these sense ﬁbres. The other major
uses of almond are:

As a general tonic
Almond is hard to digest by individuals with weak digestive powers, so the best
method is to soak the almond kernel in water overnight. In the morning separate the
outer brownish seed coat and mash the white kernel in a blender to get a thick milky
paste. In this way, it is easily assimilated into the digestive system and does not cause
indigestion. As a general tonic, to start with, take half a teaspoonful of almond paste,
twice daily in the morning and evening, in a cup of milk, add honey according to
taste. Increase the dose of almond paste everyday until unable to digest it. For additional effects, for males give 5 g ashwagandha powder and for ladies, 5 g of shatawari
powder, along with the above almond paste. Continue this treatment for 40–60 days.

For delaying premature ejaculation
Soak one almond kernel in water, as above, and form a paste. To this paste add the
powder of 4–5 black peppers, 2 g ginger powder and sugar as per taste. Lick this
mixture, followed by milk for 60 days.

For gaining weight
Eat as much almond as possible for two months, or make a mixture of almond paste
with butter and use along with bread.

For bronchial problems, and strengthening the
male urino-genital system
Take almond kernel, ashwagandha, pippli, in equal quantities, with milk, sugar and honey.

In gynaecological problems
For relief of backache and leucorrhoea, almond is prescribed to women with ashwagandha,
pippali. The paste of bitter almond is applied on generative organs. For women rendered weak after childbirth, a paste of 3–6 almonds should be given every day.

For mentally retarded children
The paste of 3–6 almonds with milk is beneﬁcial if given every day.

Badam

61

Almond oil
It is light yellow in colour, with a mild, pleasing odour and a bland taste. It is known
as Roghan Badam in India. It is extracted by a cold process. Adulterations in the oil can
be detected by subjecting it to cold temperature; it is clear at −10°C but congeals at
−20°C. The oil is commonly adulterated or substituted with peach and apricot oil,
and, as a matter of fact, most of the oil sold as bitter almond oil is from the bitter
kernels of apricot. To detect any adulterations, shake 2 parts of oil with one part of
fuming nitric acid and one part distilled water. The mixture should not have any
colour (peach and apricot oil will give a red colour, while sesame and cottonseed oil
will give brown colour) (Culbreth, 1927).
Sweet almond oil is considered a nutritive, aphrodisiac (increases libido), mild
laxative and is used for relieving headaches. Arabic women massage their breasts with
almond oil after breastfeeding their infants.

Nutritive household preparations
Sardai
It is a cooling drink, made from soaking 2–3 almond kernels, 25 g poppy seed, a few
black peppers and rose petals until soft. Make a paste of these in a blender. Suspend
the paste in 250 ml water and ﬁlter to remove the water-insoluble portion. Ice, honey
or sugar may be added to the drink as per taste (earlier Cannabis leaves were also used
in the mixture). This drink is said to compensate for energy depletion arising from
exposure to summer heat.

Almond nut cream
As a brain tonic, steep in water, orange or lime juice 3 parts almond, 2 parts walnut,
2 parts pine kernel until soft and make a cream in a blender (Nadkarni, 1954).

Nutritive candy balls
Take 100 g each of walnut, almond, poppy seed, melon seed kernel, Trapa bispinosa
powder, with 250 g ghee, 260 g icing sugar, 2 g nutmeg, 1 g saffron, 20–22 cardamom seeds. Blanch the almond and other kernels. Wash the poppy seeds and macerate
them in water to form a pulp. Mix this pulp with blanched nuts and roast them in ghee
along with Trapa bispinosa ﬂour, constantly stirring. When the whole mass turns
brown, remove it from the heat, add sugar, followed by powders of nutmeg, saffron
and cardamom. When warm make candy balls by hand.
It is a good tonic for the brain and physical strength.

Nutritive dessert
Separately soak two teaspoonsful of black beans (Phaseolus mungo), and one of almond
kernel. When soft, remove seed coat and make a paste of both separately. Fry the bean
paste with ghee until brown. Boil it in a cup of milk and, on cooling, add almond paste
and sugar as per taste. Take this preparation for one month. It is specially recommended
for those who use their brain a lot. It provides physical strength to both males and

62

Badam

females for sexual acts, and may be used by diabetics. It also provides desired nutrition
to pregnant women.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
Nagamoto (1988) isolated anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic compounds from almond.
Kubo et al. (1990) tried it on adjuvant-induced arthritis, and the pepsin hydrolysis
product inhibited the acetic acid-induced writhing in mice and cotton pellet-induced
granuloma in rats.

As an immunity booster
Kim et al. (1996) observed that, following oral administration of amygdalin isolated
from almond, it signiﬁcantly increased body weight of rats, along with that of liver
and thymus. Oral administration of amygdalin in non-dose dependent manner suppressed humoral and cell mediated immunity and the high doses increased phagocytic
activity signiﬁcantly.

As an anti-hepatotoxic agent
Matsuda et al. (1990) tried pepsin hydrolysis products of the water soluble portion of
almond in experimental hepatitis. It suppressed the increase of connective tissue in
the liver.

Chemical studies
The seed kernel has 58.9 per cent fat, 20.8 per cent protein, 2.9 per cent minerals,
mainly calcium, phosphorus and iron. Other constituents are oxalic acid, vitamin B
and folic acid. It is one of the richest sources of vitamin E. It has high concentration
of glutamic acid, arginine, asparagine and aspartic acid. Bitter almond has more
protein and less fat. It has 2.5 to 3.5 per cent amygadalin, which after hydrolysis
produces hydrocyanic acid, which is poisonous.

Toxicological studies
The bitter variety contains hydrocyanic acid in its essential oil. About 60 seeds of
these are enough to kill an adult. The sweeter variety contains a very low concentration
of cyanides and hence it is safe.

On the basis of the detailed literature survey, in addition to the above herbs, it has
been observed that the following plants are also considered to be one or other form of
bala:
Abutilin indicum Atibala or Kangi in trade
Sida alba, S. althaefolia, S. alnifolia, S. herbacea, S. lanceolata, S. orientalis, S. retusa, S.
rotundifolia, and S. rhomboidea.
Grewia hirsuta, G. populifolia, and G. tenax
Triumfetta rotundifolia
THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
Bala means strength in Sanskrit. Commonly Sida cordifolia (Figs. 5A and B), is considered the source of this drug. Atibala is deﬁnitely Abutilon (Chunekar and Pandey,
1969). Yellow ﬂowered S. rhombifolia (Figs. 5C and D) is also a strong candidate for
bala while white ﬂowered S. rhomboidea is mahabala, S. veronicaefola syn. S. humilis and
S. spinosa is nagbala (Nag is Sanskrit for snake and also for spine, hence both the
prostate and spiny species come under this category). Grewia hirsuta and G. populifolia
are also considered nagbala by some authors but in trade they are known by the name
Gangeran. Sometimes S. spinosa is further split into two species, S. alba if it has white
ﬂowers and S. alnifolia if it has coloured ﬂowers.
Some scholars have formed a separate group of ﬁve Sida spp., which they call Panch
bala (ﬁve balas). These are:

Some other scholars on the basis of the number of bala used in a composition, form
different groups, which are as follows:

Baladivya

Balachaturya
Balapanchak

Bala and Atibala
Bala, Atibala and Nagbala
Bala, Atibalal, Nagbala, and Mahabala
when Bhumibala is added to above four species.

In commerce the whole herb of Sida spp. is known as Kharanti, and usually no
distinction is made between the various types of bala mentioned above. The seeds of
these are called Beejband and those of Abutilin indicum are called Kanghi.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Bala is used in the diseases of rakta pitta origin and is considered a healer of all
malfunctions of the body. It is mainly used for following:

As a general tonic
For nervous debility, loss of memory, virility and as an aphrodisiac. In general weakness it is said to protect the inner vital energy of the body ojas and keep away old age.
The herbs are well esteemed for strengthening the urinogenital systems of both males
and females. These help sexual inadequacies and infectious diseases, particularly those
transmitted sexually.

In gynaecological practices

In threatened abortion, strengthens placental retention in expectant mothers.
As per Ayurvedic concept leucorrhoea in females develops due to weakness in the
body. One teaspoonful of ﬁne bala powder prescribed twice daily, provides the
desired strength.
In the case of inﬂammation of the ovary, a compound preparation of bala,
Balaydighrit is given to the mother and to the newborn infant.

In Malaysia, S. veornicaefolia is used as a galactagogue and as an aid for labour parturition (Lutterodt et al. 1995).

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
1
2

For suppuration of boils formed from pus, a poultice of tender leaves is applied to
the boils. Cold water is sprinkled on occasionally. In this way the boil bursts
without surgery.
The juice of the bark is anti-inﬂammatory and is used in urtica, scorpion sting,
etc.

In burning micturition and polyurea, a ﬁne powder of root and seed with ghee and
sugar reduces inﬂammation.
In hoarseness of voice caused by too much cold, singing or crying loudly, half a
spoon of bala powder with honey clears the throat.
The decoction of the root gives relief to alcoholics, who feel dryness of mouth,
excessive thirst and burning sensation in the throat after consuming alcohol.

As a blood coagulant
In bleeding piles, where blood is passed with faeces and the problem is aggravated by
indigestion and constipation, 10 g of bala powder, boiled with 80 ml of water until
reduced to 20 ml is strained. One cup of mile is added to the ﬁltrate. This mixture is
taken in the morning. It not only helps with haemorrhoids but coagulates blood in the
other parts of the body, such as nose and mouth.

As a stimulant
The ﬂowers of S. acuta and S. rhombifolia are smoked as a stimulant and substituted for
marihuana along the Gulf coastal region of Mexico. Ephedrine has been reported from
these species (Shultes and Hofmann, 1979).

In sexual inadequacies
In males, 5 to 6 g of root powder in the morning on an empty stomach increases the
viscosity of semen and prevents its involuntary discharge. In swollen testes, a decoction
of bala, 4 teaspoons along with 2 teaspoons of castor oil, is prescribed.

Ayurvedic preparations
Bala oil
Method Make a 400 ml decoction of each of bala root, Dashmul (see under amalaki),
barley, Zizyphus fruit, Dolichos biﬂorus seed. Pulverize Tinospora, Pistacia galls, bamboo
manna, Prunus paddam, dry black grapes, Leptadenia reticulata, Glycyrrhiza and any or
all the members of Ashtvarga (see under amalaki), rock salt, Aquillaria agallocha, oleogum resin of Pinus and Cedrus, Rubia cordifolia, Santalum album, Elettaria cardamomum,
Ichnocarpus fruitescence, Hemidesmus indicus, Nardostachys grandiﬂora, aromatic lichens,
Cinnamomum spp. leaves, Valeriana, Asparagus, Withania, dill, Boerhaavia, and take cow’s
milk 4 litre, sesame oil 0.5 litre.
Make a paste of all the pulverized herbs with decoctions, milk and oil. Boil the
whole mass, until the water evaporates and only the dehydrated oil is left. Filter the
oil.
Use Massaging the body with this oil before taking bath keeps away all the vata
diseases, hastens healing, aids conception and increases sperm count. It makes the skin
healthy and wrinkle free. When used along with other bala preparations, massaging
with this oil fortiﬁes the effect of these preparations.

Baladighrit
Method Make a coarse powder of 500 g each of S. cordifolia root, S. spinosa stem, bark
of Terminalia arjuna, and boil them in 8 litres of water until reduced to about 2 litres.
To this decoction add 750 g ghee, heat again until all the water evaporates and only
fatty matter is left.
Dose One spoonful with sugar twice daily.
Use

For heart problems, dry coughs and the other diseases attributable to vata.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As an immunomodulator
Out of many plants considered as bala, three plants, Abutilon indicum, Sida rhombifolia,
and S. cordifolia, are preferred. To ﬁnd out which of the three herbs has a Rasayana-like
activity, a comparative study was conducted by Dixit et al. (1978) on these for the
following:
1
2
3
4

Hormonal antibody enhancing response against Salmonella typhi O antigens in
rabbits.
Protective effect against Staphylococcus aureus.
Direct antibacterial activity against S. aureus.
Immunoglobulin changes in the serum following the administration of herbs.

Out of these herbs, Abutilon indicum was the most effective for prolonging the lifespan of animals against virulent S. aureus. The gain in body weight was also signiﬁcant. A. indicum did not have any direct antibacterial activity. Its effect was due to
anabolism and immunostimulation of the body systems.

As an adaptogen
In a study, Sharma (1981) used S. spinosa for patients suffering from loss of vigour. There
was a good response to physical and mental conditions, with increases in energy and
weight. It made the patients happy and conﬁdent and increased their digestive power and
appetite, whilst regulating bowel movements. The patients slept well with good dreams.
It helped the proper development of secondary sexual characters and increased libido.

Hormonal effects
Venkitaraman and Radhkrishnan (1976) observed myotrophic and androgenic activity in
the steroidal fraction of the root of S. retusa and S. rhombifolia in castrated rats. Lutterodt
et al. (1995) found that when methanol extract of leaves of S. veronicifolia was administered to pregnant and non pregnant rats, the extract-induced the release of oxytocin
after 5 minutes of administration but it was not statistically signiﬁcant in pregnant rats.

Bala

69

Anti-inﬂammatory activity
The petroleum ether fraction from A. indicum root had an analgesic effect due to gallic
acid (Bagi et al. 1985), while Lutterodt (1988) noted a muscarine-like activity in
S. veronicifolia.

In poliomyelitis
Nair et al. (1980) observed a positive effect of Sida spp. in chronic cases of poliomyelitis.

As an antibacterial agent
Alcoholic extracts of S. cordifolia, S. rhomboidea and Triumfetta rotundifolia exhibited
antibacterial activity against bacteria (Alam et al. 1991b). In another study by Bhatt
et al. (1985) fatty acids of petroleum ether fraction showed good antibacterial activity
against Staphylococcus aureus and fairly good against Escherichia coli.

Antihepatotoxic activity
The powder and different extracts of the whole plant showed anti-hepatotoxic activity
comparable with silymarin (Rao and Mishra, 1998). Earlier Alam et al. (1991a) studied
the effect of alcohol extracts of S. cordifolia, S. rhomboidea and Triumfetta rotundifolia.
These extracts reduced serum and liver proteins. Muanza (1995) evaluated anticancer
and anti-HIV activities and observed cytotoxic effects in the methanol extract of
S. cordifolia leaves.

Kshirdhara
It is a special treatment, which is carried out by Ayurvedic physicians in the state
of Kerala, south India. In kshirdhara (kshir is milk and dhara is uniform ﬂow of a
ﬂuid) medicated milky emulsion is allowed to fall on the forehead of the patients.
Ramu et al. (1982) treated the patients of anxiety neurosis by subjecting them to this
treatment for 15 days. The authors prepared a decoction by boiling 50 g each of
Glycyrrhiza glabra, Nardostachys grandiﬂora and Sida cordifolia in 6 litres of water,
until the water was reduced to 2 litres. This decoction was mixed with 1.5 litres of
milk. This mixture was poured into a pot with a hole at the bottom, in the centre.
The pot was hung just above the head of the patients, in such a way that the liquid
fell on the forehead. This treatment gave relief to 80 per cent patients of anxiety
neurosis.

Chemical studies
The main compounds reported from the plants used as bala are: asparagine, vascine,
vasicinone, pseudoephedrine, cryptolerine, hypaphorine, phenylethylamine, carboxylated
tryptamines. Saponins and true tannins are absent but pseudotannins, oligosaccharides,
ﬂavonoids, choline, fructsopeptides, histidine glucine, tyrosine, oxalic acid, and phenolic
acids are present (Lutterodt, 1988). Gallic acid is reported by Sharma et al. (1989).
The biological activity of the herb is due to ephedrine and ephedrine-like compounds.

Banslochan 71

12 Banslochan

Syn: Tabashir
Melocanna bambusoides Trin.
It is a bluish, translucent, silicious concretion. The genuine material is obtained from
the bamboo which was earlier identiﬁed as Bambusa arundinacea Willd., but studies by
Puri (1984) have shown that the real source of banslochan is Melocanna bambusoides Trin.
In this bamboo, the internodal region of the young female plant ﬁlls with sap. This
sap is considered very nutritious and invigorating by inhabitants of the area and is
drunk on exhaustion and for quenching thirst. When the plant matures the sap gets
dried, and deposited inside the nodal region in the form of concretion. These banslochancontaining bamboo produce a rattling sound with the movement of wind or on shaking, and thus can be easily distinguished from non-concretion-containing plants. The
concretion is collected by splitting bamboo longitudinally. The natural banslochan is
very hard to obtain and is very expensive. It is very commonly substituted by synthetic silica.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYUREVEDA
Tabashir is mainly used for curing diseases of the region under the ribs, such as the
thorax, lungs, intestine, etc. and for debility. It is an ingredient of a number of
polyherbal and polymineral formulations. The common recipe for debility diseases of
infants and young children consists of ﬁne powders of long pepper 1/2 part, cardamom
grain 1/4 part, cinnamon 1/8 part, tabashir 1 part and sugar 2 parts.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As a nutrient for the bones and the cartilages
Banslochan mainly consists of silica, which is one of the important components of
connective tissue, cartilage, articulation tendons, arterial walls, skin, hair and nails.
It has an effective remineralisation action in painful joints, fragility of the cartilage,
osteoporosis and atherosclerosis. It stimulates the natural defence of the body during
growth, pregnancy, repair of fractures, senescence, etc. Silica helps in calcium ﬁxation

72

Banslochan

by bones and improves the texture of collagen. As soon as the silica level in body
tissue decreases, the calcium level goes up and elasticity is reduced. It helps in the
assimilation of phosphorus for osteoporosis. Silica supplemented bones have 100 per
cent increase in collagen over low silica bones. It is instrumental in faster healing of
bones, and is a component of both the connective tissue and the ﬂuid, which lubricate
the joints. The lubricated joints move friction free, thus lessening the chances of
inﬂammation.

In coronary heart problems
In areas where water contains low silica levels, the incidence of heart diseases are
higher. Levels of silicon in the arterial wall decrease with the development of
atherosclerosis. With silica deﬁciency, the arterial walls become non-elastic and are
unable to accommodate variation in blood pressure.

As an antibacterial agent
Banslochan inhibited the growth of bacteria, probably due to the deposition of silica
on the bacterial cell wall, which may have blocked the passage of nutrients from the
medium into the bacterial body, or may have been due to its interaction with the
proteinaceous cell wall, which produces an effect similar to that of silicosis. A comparative study on the binding of tabashir and silicic acid on the bacterial cell wall
showed that in the two cases the nature of binding was similar (Malik and Shakil
Ahmed, 1973).

In hormonal imbalance
Hormonal disturbance in the human organisms is sometimes due to calcium–
magnesium imbalance. Silica can restore this balance.

As an immunostimulant
The skin, aorta and thymus (which activates the immune system) show a marked
reduction in silica as we age. A deﬁciency of silica in the body exposes it to many
diseases and makes it vulnerable to injury.

In degenerative diseases
Silica counteracts the effects of aluminium on the body and thus prevents Alzheimer’s
disease. The regenerative power of silica acts as a biological catalyst for tissues to
regain their tone and elasticity.

Chemical studies
It consists of silicic acid (96.9 per cent), iron, calcium, choline and betaine.

Bhalatak

13 Bhalatak

Semecarpus anacardium L.f.
Anacardiaceae
It is known as ‘marking nut’ because the black oil contained in the seed’s pericarp was
previously used by washer men for making a permanent identiﬁcation mark on the cloth.
THE TREE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a middle sized deciduous tree, growing in the outer Himalayas, and in other
warmer areas of India. Leaves are (Fig. 6A) 20–60 cm long, and 10–30 cm wide.
Flowers are greenish yellow, in terminal panicle. The fruit is (Fig. 6B) 2.5 cm long,
drupe, ovoid, and smooth lustrous black. The oil is highly vesicant. The kernel of the
fruit is almond-like inside, but causes cutaneous eruptions if eaten (Wealth of India,
1972).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The seed has Rasayana-like action but has a hot effect. It is considered beneﬁcial for
strength, vigour, vitality, in nervous disorders due to sexual exhaustion and in senile
decay. In Indian medicine it is used in the treatment of arthritis and several other free
radical mediated diseases, facial paralysis and in sciatica. Its continuous use combats
ageing and those who have used it have wrinkle-free skin and black hair. It is considered so important that in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, in a village near Faizabad,
a special fair called Bhela ka Mela is held, in which patients of various diseases are
treated with this nut (Ahmed et al. 1993). The nut is not used as such but is mitigated, or treated using various methods to reduce the toxicity, as follows:

Puriﬁcation of Bhalatak
Before puriﬁcation the nuts are immersed in water. The fruits which sink are kept for
processing, whilst ﬂoating ones are discarded. The juice from the pericarp is very
corrosive, so precaution is taken so that the seed does not touch any part of body. The
nuts, after removal of the crown, are mixed with a ﬁne powder of bricks in a cotton
bag. These are rubbed against brick powder until they are scraped enough to release

Bhalatak

75

Figure 6 Semecarpus anacardium A twig, B seed.

the vesicant oil. When the brick powder has absorbed all the oil, the seeds are washed
in hot water.
In Kerala, a state in south India, the nuts are ﬁrst crushed to separate the kernels.
These are then immersed in cow’s urine for three days. During the day the seeds are
taken out and exposed to sun. After this treatment for three days, the kernels are
boiled in a decoction of Terminalia bellirica and then in a solution of cow dung, before
being dried and washed with rice gruel (Shanvaskhan et al. 1997).
If blisters are formed during handling of the nut, they may be treated with the juice
of Amaranthus polygamous, or a paste of Terminalia chebula or sesame seed in butter or
milk. Alternatively a paste of macerated almond and coconut oil or coriander seed may

76

Bhalatak

be used or the juice of the leaves of Cassia tora or C. ﬁstula. If poisonous symptoms develop
during the administration of this seed, the patient is given a decoction of T. chebula or
Sesamum indicum along with seed powder of Embelia ribes (Shanavaskhan et al. 1997).

Methods of using Bhalatak as Rasayana without toxicity
(Vaidya, 1998).

Fill seven earthen pots with soil in which 1 kg of pounded bhalatak are mixed and
fenugreek grown in it. For irrigation do not use pure water but a decoction, made
from 3 kg of crushed nuts. In winter, when the fenugreek crop is ready, cook and
eat the leaves of one pot daily. Continue this for seven days. During the treatment
spices and pepper should be avoided but bitters and a bit of salt may be used. This
fenugreek is hot in effect, so hot spicy, non-vegetarian food and sexual intercourse
should be avoided
Take 35 kg of nuts, after crushing them, use them as manure in a quarter acre of
land to cultivate fenugreek. Eat the fresh leaves as salad for three months. Do not
cook them. Radish can be grown in place of fenugreek and eaten raw.
Remove the crown from one marking nut and heat it in 25 g of butter until
smoke starts coming out of it. Make an omelette with this butter. Discard both
the nut and omelette but use the butter for vitality.
Remove the crown from 1 kg of nuts and boil them in 20 litres of milk. Separate
the cream of the milk and make butter from it. Take about 3 g of this butter
every day. To provide strength to the sexual organs massage them with this
butter.
Boil one crushed bhalatak nut in 16 times water, until water is reduced to half.
Measure the quantity of decoction obtained, add eight times as much milk to it
and boil it again until the whole mass is condensed to half. Lubricate the mouth
and throat with butter and swallow 12–25 g of this milk.
For acute inﬂammation arising from an accident, take one processed bhalatak, fry
it in ghee, make halwa (porridge) and eat as much as possible.

External applications
For cracking soles and feet, an ointment is applied which is made by boiling bhalatak
seed with rosin, bees wax and sesame oil.
When the body is massaged with bhalatak oil, it makes a person immune to all
kinds of skin diseases and it turns grey hair black.

Ayurvedic preparations
Bhalatak Rasayana
Method Pulverize equal quantities of ginger, Embelia ribes, processed iron, and bhalatak.
Dose 1 g with ghee and honey for three months.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

In various types of cancer
The extracts of the fruit were effective against human epidermoid carcinoma of the
naso-pharynx. Oral administration of nut juice to cancer patients, particularly those
suffering from mouth cancer, provided symptomatic relief. It also extended the survival time (Wealth of India, 1972). Anti-tumour activity of the chloroform soluble
fraction was tested on a spectrum of experimental neoplasms. The fraction showed
a signiﬁcant increase in percent lifespan of leukaemia L12120, P388 resistant either
to adriamycin and/or vincristine (Chitnis et al. 1980). The cytotoxic effects of acetylated
oil on P388 lymphocytic leukaemia cell was tested in vitro. The oil inhibited biosynthesis
of DNA, RNA and protein (The oil was acetylated because pure oil gets oxidized
easily) (Phatak, 1983). Smit et al. (1995) conﬁrmed the strong cytotoxic effect of the
nut, which may be of use in cancer. Premlatha et al. (1997) studied the effect of
Anacardium nut milk extract on hepatocellular carcinoma. A marked increase in liver
peroxide livels and a concomitant decrease in enzymatic antioxidant levels were
observed in rat liver cancer. Tripathi et al. (1998) studied the effect of this drug on the
cell cycle and cell viability of transformed prostate cells. The plant extract signiﬁcantly arrested the cell cycle. At higher concentrations, it affected cell viability. The
response was dose dependent.

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
The alcoholic extract of the nut protected the animals against electrically-induced
convulsions but was not effective against chemical convulsions. An extract from the
nut, containing catechin and epicatechin, helped in sciatica and was effective in
ankylostomiasis. Catechin increased capillary resistance. When studied for inﬂammation, epicatechin produced a signiﬁcant reduction in rat paw oedema (Mujumdar,
1977). Upadhyay et al. (1986) used the drug for anti-inﬂammatory and anti-arthritic
effects. Of patients given 5–10 g bhalatak twice daily, 40 per cent showed complete
remission, 20 per cent showed improvement and the rest minor effects. It also helped
body pain, appetite, indigestion and the haemoglobin content in patients’ blood.
Sharma and Singh (1986) conducted a clinical trial of a preparation Amrita Bhallataka
on patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. A signiﬁcant symptomatic relief was
seen with less need for analgesics.
A Siddha preparation Serankottai Nei made from the milk extract of the nuts, said
to have a good anti-arthritic effect, was studied by Vijayalakshmi et al. (1996, 1997).
After administering this preparation, the lysosomal enzyme activity and protein-bound

78

Bhalatak

carbohydrate component levels became signiﬁcantly normal. It was effective at a dose
of 150 mg/kg in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The lysosomal membrane fragility of drug-treated animals was reduced.

Hypocholesterolic effect
The nut shell extract is hypocholesterolaemic in its action and prevents cholesterolinduced atheroma (Sharma et al. 1995).

Chemical studies
Major constituents are mono- and di-hydroxycatechols and tannins. The vesicant juice
is rich in phenols (Thakur et al. 1989).

Toxicological studies
Many people are sensitive to it and after its consumption may pass darker urine with
or without blood. There may be skin eruptions, itching, hot ﬂushes, diarrhoea and
even delirium. To counteract these side effects, the tender kernel of coconut fruit or fat
and butter should be given.

Eclipta prostrata L. Syn. E. alba (L.) Hassk.
Family: Asteraceae (Compositae)
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
Bhringraj grows wild alongside streams in hot areas and on humid soil. It is an erect
or prostate herb (Fig. 7A), leaves 2.5 to 7.5 cm, with white hairs. Floral heads are 6–
8 mm in diameter, solitary and white. Seed is black in colour, achene and compressed.
It is often called white bhringraj or white bhangra to differentiate it from another
plant Wedelia calendulacea Less. (Fig. 7B) which has yellow ﬂowers and is also known as
yellow bhangra. Whereas E. alba grows all over the country W. calendulacea is found
only in some parts of east and south India (Bhargava and Seshadri, 1974). A brief
account of W. calendulacea is given in the end of this chapter.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA

For digestive problems
Bhringraj is used as an antihepatotoxic agent and for spleen enlargement. Root is
emetic and purgative. In jaundice 20 g of fresh leaves with 7 black peppers are
administered daily for 5–6 days.

For gynaecological problems
The herb is used to prevent abortion and miscarriage. It gives relief in cases of uterine
pains and uterine haemorrhage, after the delivery.

As an antiinﬂammatory agent
The paste of the herb is applied externally as an antiinﬂammatory agent. Decoction of
the plant is used as a tonic for arthritis.

For cold
Juice of the herb with honey is used for catarrh in children.

Bhringraj 81

Figure 7 A Eclipta alba twig, B Wedelia calendulacea twig.

For hair growth
An oil made with leaf juice, boiled with sesame or coconut oil, is used for hair growth,
delaying premature greying of hair and headaches.

For healing wounds
The fresh plant or its juice is applied for toothache. It is considered an antiseptic and
applied to ulcers and wounds in cattle. The pounded plant is used to stop bleeding.

82

Bhringraj

As a Rasayana
It is considered a medhya (nervine tonic) and a Rasayana. The seed (1 to 3 g) is used as
an aphrodisiac. The juice (5–10 ml) is prescribed for one month as a part of Rasayana
treatment. While administering the juice, the patient should survive only on milk.

In Chinese traditional medicine
It is used as an astringent for various types of haemorrhages, for example of the
intestine (the vomiting of blood), haematuria, lumbago, epistaxis, cystitis and hepatitis.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATION AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Antihepatotoxic activity
Samana and Ramaswamy (1976) conﬁrmed the protective effect of the herb against
liver damage in dogs. Dixit and Achar (1979) tried a ﬁne powder of herb for infective
hepatitis. In 75 per cent cases there was recovery. In another study Dixit and Achar
(1981) tried the powder of 50 mg/kg of the herb in 3 doses for jaundice in children
and in the majority of cases it showed complete clinical and biochemical recovery in 1
to 5 weeks. It was concluded that this antihepatotoxic activity may be due to the antiviral and anti-microbial activity of the herb. Devinder Kumar et al. (1981), through
biochemical and histopathological studies, observed that the aqueous extract, equivalent to 5 g of dry herb, regularized liver abnormalities caused by carbon tetrachloride.
Dube et al. (1982) used 50 mg of the extract three times a day for hepatocellular
jaundice. It cured 55 per cent cases of jaundice within 3– 4 weeks of treatment.
Thyagarajan et al. (1982) observed immunoactive property in Eclipta against the surface
antigen of hepatic B-virus. Wagner et al. (1986) detected coumestans as the active
principle. Eclipta, when tried against various ailments of liver and gall bladder, exhibited signiﬁcant stimulatory effects on liver cell enlargement. Raut et al. (1986) studied
the effect of the herb on peptic ulcers, non-ulcer dyspepsia and the liver. When given
along with Indian thyme (Ptychotis ajwain DC) a cholagogue property was observed in
patients with derangement of the liver and gall bladder. Kumar and Tripathi (1987)
also tried the herb for managing liver diseases. Chandra et al. (1987) studied the effect
of herb on inﬂammation and liver injury and found that it counteracted liver weight
and hepatic lipid peroxidation. Alcoholic extract using 50 mg/kg once a day for 7 days
was found to be antihepatotoxic (Mogre et al. 1988). Singh et al. (1993) and Murthy et
al. (1993) also found a hepatoprotective effect. Lin (1996) observed a hepatoprotective
effect in an extract of herb against carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen and betaD-galactosamine-induced liver damage.
Premilla (1995) reviewed the antihepatotoxic activity of the herb.

Antihaemorrhagic activity
Kosuge et al. (1981) studied antihaemorrhagic principles of herb for homeostatic
action.

Bhringraj 83

Cardiovascular effect
Gupta et al. (1976) observed cardiovascular (cardiodepressant) activity in it when used
for hepatic congestion, venous enlargement and turgidity. The water soluble fraction
of the leaves produced a hypotensive effect unrelated to histaminergic and cholinergic
mechanism. The polypeptide mixture had a tranquillizing effect. It induced rapid onset
of pentobarbitone sodium’s hypnotic activity. The average sleeping time was almost
doubled by a crude extract dose of 2.5 mg/kg. Hypotensive effect was immediate and
it lasted for 10–15 minutes. When clinical trials were undertaken using a decoction
from 25 g of powder daily for 3 weeks, 73 per cent of hypertensive patients showed a
good response. There were no headaches, insomnia or palpitations but urine output
increased. Rashid et al. (1992) also observed antihypertensive activity in ethanol extract.
The active constituent detected was culumbin.

In ulcers
Tewari (personal communication, 1979) tried 10 g of whole plant powder three times
a day on 35 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and 25 patients with peptic ulcer
dyspepsia for 3 months. A complete symptomatic relief in epigastric pain, nausea
and vomiting was seen. There was a reduction in ﬂatulence and the amount of free
gastric acid. Eighty per cent of the patients of non-ulcer dyspepsia responded well,
with relief in acid secretion, nocturnal pain, nausea and vomiting. In 48 per cent of
patients with duodenal ulcer the results were excellent while in 75 per cent of cases
there was radiological improvement. Raut et al. (1986) tried the herb for ulcers and
peptic ulcers. Das (1992) studied the effect of the herb on gastritis by administering
12 g of pulverized herb daily, in three divided doses, for 45 days. In 52 per cent of
cases of gastritis the results were excellent. In hyperchlorhydria there was total relief.

Antiinﬂammatory effect
Reddy et al. (1990) observed that Eclipta exhibited anti-inﬂammatory activity. It
inhibited the higher levels of histamine due to chronic inﬂammation by 58.67 per
cent.

Antivenomous effect
Melo et al. (1994) tested the aqueous extract of the herb and the three constituents,
wadelolactone, stigmasterol and sitosterol, for protective effects against three crotalid
venoms and three crotalid myotoxins. All the herbal preparations inhibited the myotoxic
effects of the snake venom. Wadelolactone was an effective antagonist of the myotoxins.
The aqueous extract and wadelolactone also inhibited haemorrhagic lesions.

Antimicrobial property
The alcohol extract had anti-viral activity. Polyacetylenes of the herb, in antibiotic
tests, were strongly phototoxic (UV mediated) to microorganisms. A Chinese study
has also shown that thiophenes in the herb are phototoxic to bacteria, fungi, nematodes and yeast.

84

Bhringraj

Chemical studies
The main constituent is wadelolactone, a complex coumarin, alkaloid, with nicotine
0.08 per cent and nicotinic acid. The root contains polyacetylenes substituted thiophene
derivatives and free triterpenoids.

Toxicological studies
In acute and sub-acute toxicity the behaviour of rats was normal, but in chronic
toxicity they become dull and lethargic. The water intake was reduced and they were
indifferent to their surroundings. There were no appreciable changes in the body
weight of organs. No side or toxic effects were observed after the study of biochemical parameters and histopathology of liver, kidney, spleen and heart (Rashid et al.
1992).

Wedelia calendulacea Less
As mentioned earlier, Eclipta is sometimes substituted by this herb. The chemical and
pharmacological studies have shown that this substitution is appropriate, as both have
the same types of chemical constituents and effect.
In this herb coumestans was found to be the main active principle for liver protection (Wagner 1986). Sharma et al. (1989) noted that 50 per cent alcohol extract of the
herb had a heptoprotective effect. It protected the functional and structural activity of
the liver. Gopalkrishnan et al. (1989) also observed anti-hepatotoxic activity in it.
It counteracted the increase in liver weight, hepatic liver peroxidation and serum
alkaline phosphates induced by carbon tetrachloride. Hegde et al. (1994) noted that
herb had a wound healing effect on rats.

P. virgatus Forst, Syn. P. simplex Retz.
Family: Euphorbiaceae
THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
The plant species given above are called bhuiamalaki in Ayurveda because the leaves in
these have a superﬁcial resemblance to those of the amalaki (Emblica ofﬁcinalis) tree and
the small fruits in these prostate herbs grow along the soil. Bhuiamalaki thus means a
prostate amalaki and the corrupted form of this name is bhuiamla.
The herb is probably a native of tropical America. In nearly all the earlier literature,
the herb bhuiamla was identiﬁed as Phyllanthus niruri and it is reported as such in most
of the Indian ﬂoras, but recent studies have shown bhuiamla to be a mixture of at least
three species: P. amarus, P. fraternus, and P. debilis. There is a possibility that other
allied species are identiﬁed as bhuiamla. The true P. niruri is endemic to the West
Indies and has not been found to occur in India (Thakur et al. 1989). P. debilis is
conﬁned to the coastal areas of India, while the other two species are widespread
throughout the plains. The other species which can be considered as the source of
bhuiamala is P. maderaspatensis (Singh et al. 1994). Keeping in view the medicinal
importance of this genera, studies were carried out in the allied species. In P. urinaria
there were signiﬁcant differences amongst the intraspeciﬁc accessions. Accessions of
P. amarus from various locations were not signiﬁcantly different (Unander and Blumberg,
1991).
Herbal Phyllanthus species (Fig. 8) are small annual, creeping or erect plants, growing
in moist, shady places in most parts of India. Leaves are elliptic oblong, obovate oblong
or obtuse, varying in different species. Flowers are axillary, unisexual or bisexual.
Capsules are round and vary in shape and size. All these species are characterized by
the fruits growing along the underside of the leaves
The four important species of Indian Phyllanthus spp. growing in the plains of India,
on the basis of a dichotomous key given by Bagchi et al. (1992), can be identiﬁed as
follows:

Bhuiamla

In jaundice
Fifteen grams of the crushed herb with a cup of milk is given in the morning and
evening. Dry leaves, in powder form, may also be prescribed (Nadakarni, 1954).
For jaundice in Silent Valley (Kerala), 10 g of this herb, with 10 g of the root bark
of Cassia auriculata L. is made into paste and administered with cow’s milk for three
days, on an empty stomach in the morning (Bhatt et al. 1981).
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
According to Bagchi et al. (1992) much of the earlier botanical, phytochemical and
pharmacological work previously reported from India on P. niruri was apparently done
on P. fraternus, P. amarus or P. debilis. The summary of these ﬁndings is as follows:

Immunomodulator activity
The crude extract, as well as the red pigment of the herb, had immunoactivating
ability against HBsAg (Thakur et al., 1989).

Effect on the liver
Children suffering from jaundice were given the herb in powder form. In the majority
of cases, hepatic tenderness disappeared with improvement in appetite (Dixit and
Achar, 1983). It also helped in alcohol-induced fatty liver development (Umarani et al.
1985) and was used in jaundice due to liver damage by Shyamsunder et al. (1985). The
effect of alcohol-induced liver cell damage in non-hepatectomised rats was studied by
Agarwal et al. (1986). It protected induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured hepatocytes
and also provided protection against cytotoxicity induced by lead, aluminium salts
(Dhir et al. 1990) and by nickel chloride (Agarwal et al. 1992). P. niruri was found
effective in induced hepatotoxicity in calves (Kohale et al. 1993). According to Satyan
et al. (1994) both P. niruri and P. urinaria, provided protection to the liver due to a
major bioactive lignan, phyllanthin. P. urinaria lacked phyllanthin, so the protective
effect was less in this case. For comparison, Sane (1995) studied the hepatoprotective
effect of both P. amarus and P. debilis on the liver by bringing about a change in the
various constituents of serum by carbon tetrachloride. P. debilis was more potent than
P. amarus. Polya et al. (1995) found that hydrolyzable tannins from P. amarus were the
most speciﬁc potent inhibitors of the rat cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase catalytic
sub unit.
Effect on Hepatitis B virus: This study is important because a relationship between
hepatoma and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection exists. Deﬁnite immune inactive
properties of Phyllanthus against the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus was reported
by Thygarajan et al. (1982). These authors (Thygarajan et al. 1988) observed that
P. amarus clears the chronic state of the B virus. Venkateswaran et al. (1987) studied
the effect of an extract of P. niruri on hepatitis B and woodchuck hepatitis viruses. It
inhibited woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA polymerase and surface antigen expression.
Jayaram et al. (1987) also conﬁrmed anti-hepatitis B virus properties of this herb after

Bhuiamla 89
clinical trials. The treatment was found quite safe, with no mortality, weight loss or
behavioural changes. Jayram et al. (1997) treated 28 chronic cases of HBV by using
P. amarus, for up to three months. Clearance was observed in 20 per cent of cases. The
study proposed a dose of 500 mg of the herb three times a day for six months. Munshi
(1993) found this herb a good agent for post exposure prophylaxis in neonatal duck
hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection. Milne (1994) standardized the extract of P. amarus
to contain 200 mg of geraniin. The results indicated that this extract had no effect on
New Zealand hepatitis B carriers. Alonso et al. (1995) tried an alcohol extract of
Phyllanthus spp. and the ﬂavonoids of the herb inactivated the surface antigen in vitro
in HBV. Unamder et al. (1995), after a review, concluded that the herb has some use
as an anti-viral agent to treat jaundice and liver diseases. It acted as a liver tonic in the
case of non-hepatitis B virus diseases. The effects on chronic infection with HBV or
related viruses have generally been negative. Ott et al. (1997) observed that P. amarus
suppresses hepatitis B virus by interrupting interactions between HBV enhancer I
and cellular transcriptase factors. Jayaram et al. (1997) carried out clinical trials on
the patients of acute viral hepatitis A, B, and non-A, and non-B. After four weeks,
signiﬁcant biochemical and clinical normalcy in hepatic virus A infected patients was
observed. It seemed to accelerate the clearance of the majority of HBV patients. Karin
(1999) isolated seven ellagitannins from P. urinaria, which had strong activity against
Epstein Barr virus.

Antidiabetic effect
Hukeri et al. (1988) conﬁrmed hypoglycaemic activity of P. fraternus in rats.
Sivaprakasam et al. (1995) tried P. amarus in 25 diabetic patients. Statistically signiﬁcant lowering of blood sugar levels was observed with a dose of 1 g, thrice daily for
three months. Srividya and Periwal (1995) observed diuretic, hypotensive and
hypoglycaemic effects of the herb. Blood glucose was signiﬁcantly reduced without
any side effects. It also lowered the cystolic blood pressure in non-diabetic, hypertensive females. Moshi et al. (1997) conﬁrmed non-insulin dependent hypoglycaemic activity
in P. amarus.

Effect on fat metabolism
The herb caused increased depletion of triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids found
in liver, heart and kidney and brought them down to normal levels (Umarani, 1985).

Effect on vascular system
An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor from P. niruri was isolated (Ueno et al.
1988). Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide and could be involved in the
development of hypertension in man. A non-peptide endothelial antagonist has been
reported from P. niruri (Hussain, 1995).

Anti-bacterial property
Cruz (1994) observed that a hexane fraction of P. urinaria leaves have an antibacterial
effect. Unander (1995) conﬁrmed it.

90

Bhuiamla

Anti-nociceptive activity
This activity was observed from an extract of the herb. It failed to inhibit formalininduced paw oedema (Santos et al. 1995).

Antioxidant property
Three compounds isolated from P. niruri, were six times more potent than quercitin
for inhibiting aldose reductase (Shimizu et al. 1989). P. niruri caused a 50 per cent
inhibition of superoxide scavenging activity, and potent inhibition of lipid peroxide
formation. It was a scavenger of hydroxyl radical in vitro, which shows it to be a good
antioxidant ( Joy and Kuttan, 1995).

Anti-spasmodic activity
P. urinaria extract had a relaxant effect on isolated trachea (Paulino et al. 1996).

Anti-fungal activity
This activity of the herb against Helminthosporium sativum and Alternaria alternata has
been reported (Thakur et al. 1989).

Chemical studies
Many lignanas have been isolated from various species. Phyllanthin is a major bioactive lignan but it is absent in P. urinaria (Satyan et al. 1994). Five ﬂavonoids, four
leucodelphins and two alkaloids have also been reported. (Thakur et al. 1989). From
the alcoholic extract of P. niruri Ueno et al. (1988) isolated ellagic acid, gallic acid and
geraniin. These exhibited angiotensin converting enzyme activity.

Bacopa monnieri (L.) Penn.
Syn. Herpestis monniera (L.) H.B.K.
Bacopa monniera Wettst.
Moniera cuneifolia Michx.
Family: Scorphulariaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a small prostate herb (Fig. 9A,B) with ascending branches and serrate, entire,
oblong or obovate, 2.5 long and 0.6 cm wide leaves. The ﬂower is solitary and the
fruit is an ovoid capsule with persistent style. The plant grows in damp places and
marshy grounds on the majority of the Indian plains.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Earlier Centella asiatica was known as brahmi to distinguish it from Centella; it is known
in the trade as jal brahmi (brahmi growing along water) or jal neem (neem is Azadirachta
indica and this herb is as bitter as neem, so it was called hygrophytic neem). Even now
Centella is sometimes used in place of this herb.
The literal meaning of brahmi is which expands consciousness. According to Hindu
mythology Brahma is one of the three gods of trinity, who controlled the world during
its origin. The other names of this herb in ancient texts are: Sureshta – liked
by gods, Divy – divine, Saraswati, Sharad, Bharati – goddesses of learning (the herb is
named after these goddessess to show that it has a good effect on intellectuality),
Vayastha – arrests old age, Sharma – charming and Medhya – good for mental work.
It is one of the three medhya herbs of Ayurveda, used for psychoactive diseases. It has
a beneﬁcial effect on intelligence and memory by reducing anxiety and tension. It is
considered a nervine tonic for neurasthenia, epilepsy, insanity and for nervous breakdown. For learning and memory up to 30 ml of plant juice is given twice daily before
breakfast in the morning and two hours after dinner. It is quite bitter so honey is
added to it to make it palatable.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Psychotropic effects
To conﬁrm the identity of brahmi, Singh et al. (1975) studied the therapeutic activities of both Centella and Bacopa and concluded that Bacopa was the source of brahmi.
This herb showed signiﬁcant psychotropic action as evidenced by excessive sleep and
conformation changes in the brain, as well as in the blood. A signiﬁcant barbiturate
hypnosis potentiation effect was observed, with reductions in the acetylcholine and
cholinesterase content of the brain tissue and the blood.
Earlier studies had shown that the herb’s alkaloid brahmine resembled strychnine in
its stimulating action but was less toxic (Chopra et al. 1955). Deshpande and Lalta

96

Brahmi

Prasad (1978) observed sedation and nembutal hypnosis effect in the herb, which
showed better effects than Luminal. It did not produce dizziness, nausea or vomiting
and could be used for cardiac patients. When tried by Nair et al. (1976) on patients of
tubercular meningitis, it could not prevent convulsions but reduced the severity and
hastened recovery in the post-convulsive stage. To study its effect on memory, Dey
et al. (1976) observed that this herb produced maximum improvement during maze
learning by albino rats. Singh et al. (1979) observed an anti-anxiety effect in the
alcoholic extract of the herb. The saponins showed a signiﬁcant barbiturate potentiation
effect. It was effective in anxiety neurosis after one month of treatment (Singh and
Singh, 1980). There was signiﬁcant relief in symptoms and quantitative reduction in
the level of anxiety. It had an adaptogenic effect also. Khanna and Ahmed (1992) used
the herb in the treatment of epilepsy and postulated that it acted through β-adrenergic
receptors. Martis et al. (1992) experimented with the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of
the herb. The extracts did not produce sedation or muscle incordination and they had
no anti-depressant action. Singh and Dhawan (1994) carried out pre-clinical neuropsychopharmaceutical investigations on the active constituents of the herb bacoside. It
was found to be nootropic and a memory enhancer. Dar and Channa (1997) observed
a complete relaxant effect with the alcohol extract of the herb. Vohora et al. (1997)
isolated a new triterpene bacosine from the herb, which was opioidergic in nature. It
exhibited moderate analgesic effects. For the study of anxiolytic activity, the standardised extract of the herb was compared with lorazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic
agent. The standardised extract produced a dose related anxiolytic activity, which, in
certain respects was better than lorazepam (Bhattacharya and Ghoshal, 1998).
Abhang (1993) tried a herbal preparation containing Bacopa on the intelligence
quotient of 10–13 year old boys. The preparation caused a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in intelligence. A polyherbal preparation Brahmi rasyana containing Bacopa,
clove, long pepper and cardamom seed showed anti-inﬂammatory activity ( Jain et al.
1994) comparable to that of indomethacin. This preparation may act by interfering
with prostaglandin synthesis and by stabilizing the lysosomal membrane.

Anti-cancerous activity
The ethanol extract exhibited anti-cancerous activity in Sarcoma 180 cell culture
(Elangovan et al. 1995). Kiri and Khan (1996) tested the active constituents for
genotoxic activity and no chromosomal aberration was observed.

Antioxidant effect
The alcohol extract of the herb had an antioxidant effect, which showed protection
against lipid peroxidation. The memory enhancing, mild sedative effects as well as
relief in epilepsy and insomnia of this herb may be due to this antioxidant activity
(Tripathi et al. 1996).

Chemical studies
Earlier brahmine, hespestine and a mixture of three alkaloids were isolated but the
therapeutic activity of the herb has been found to be due to saponins, bacosides A
and B.

Brahmi 97
A preparation containing these bacosides has been commercialized as a memory
enhancer.

Plumbago zeylanica L.
Syn: P. rosea L.
P. capensis Thunb.
P. indica L.
Family: Plumbaginaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It grows in arid zones in most parts of India throughout the year. It is a wild growing
herb (Fig. 10) and may be up to 1 metre tall. The stem is dark brown externally and
white internally. Its leaves are 3 cm or so wide and about 5 cm long, deciduous in
summer but with leaves in rainy season. Flowers are white with a pink tinge, or sky
blue in colour but the white ﬂowers are common and the coloured ones are rare.
The root is blackish brown, knotted with horny fracture. It tastes pungent and
bitter, causing a tingling sensation. Fresh roots have been advised but usually the dry
ones are used. In south India (Shanavaskhan, 1997) the roots are detoxiﬁed before use
by treating chopped root pieces repeatedly with fresh lime water. With this treatment,
the root turns red ﬁrst, but with repeated washing the red colour fades away. In
another method, root pieces are boiled in dilute cow dung solution. (The fresh root
acts as a vesicant and cause inﬂammation and blisters. If this happen, an antidote of
5 g of Asparagus root with 200 ml of drinking yogurt is given.)
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA

As a Rasayana
Plants with sky blue ﬂowers (Plumbago capensis) are preferred for this purpose.
The root is dried, powdered and administered for one month with milk or water. It is
said to impart a long disease-free life. It delays greying of hair, increases strength,
intelligence and bestows beauty.

Figure 10 Plumbago zeylanica A twig, B dry root.

For indigestion
As per Ayurveda, this herb is considered pungent, hot, and said to increase the
body’s digestive ﬁre (agni) manyfold. It stimulates the liver and spleen and is an
antidote to the undesirable metabolites produced (ama) during digestion. Therefore
it is prescribed in all diseases which arise from a disturbed digestive system, including those caused by microbes and worms. For digestive problems, a paste of the
root made with water is heated in ghee and prescribed. A mixture of powders of
equal parts of Plumbago root, rock salt, long pepper and Terminalia chebula is also
used.

100 Chitrak

For liver problems
In hepatotoxicity due to chronic fever and in enlargement of liver and spleen, it is
prescribed with yogurt.

For loose motions
In diarrhoea, dysentery and gastroenteritis, it is prescribed with Embelia ribes and
Cyperus scariosus.

For chronic skin diseases
It is prescribed in the second stage of leprosy and syphilis.

In gynaecological practices
It causes the contraction of the uterus and may cause abortion.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Hypolipidaemic and antiatherosclerotic effects
The active constituent plumbagin increased the faecal excretion of cholesterol and
phospholipids (Purushothaman et al. 1985). It prevented the accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides in liver (Sharma et al. 1991).

Anti-tumour property
Chitrak showed the regression of experimental tumours (Purushothaman et al. 1985)
due to plumbagin, which had a growth inhibitory and radiosensitizing effect on
experimental mouse tumours. Uma Devi et al. (1994) observed that the extract of the
herb signiﬁcantly reduced tumour glutathione content. The results were better when
lower doses of the herb were used with radiation and hyperthermia.

Chitrak

101

Hormonal effect
Plumbagin has strong antiprogestational, antifertility activity (Dhar et al. 1995).

Chemical studies
Mainly naphthaquinone derivatives like plumbagin have been reported.

Toxicological studies
In large doses, the herb is a narcotic. It causes dryness of mouth, nausea, diarrhoea
and numbness of skin. In pregnant women it causes a burning sensation, bleeding,
contraction and miscarriage. The active constituent, plumbagin, was studied for its
sub-acute toxicity. It did not show any histopathological change or toxicity within
the prescribed dose (Purushothaman et al. 1985). The oral administration of the
above, 1,250 mg/kg of ethanol root extract, in rat and mice produced severe diarrhoea.
In sub-acute studies when 50 mg/kg of the extract was injected daily for 30 days, no
mortality was observed but there was no weight gain in the treated rats (Emerson
Solomon, 1993). Another extract was toxic at 100 mg/kg (Ganasoundari et al. 1997).

102 Chuara

18 Chuara

Phoenix dactylifera L
Family: Palmae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The plant mainly grows in Iraq and the other Arabian countries. It has unbranched,
erect, tall, cylindrical stem, up to 20 m tall, crowned by long pinnate, fronds, from
which spikes may arise. The other species, P. sylvestris, is found throughout drier parts
of India but the fruit in this case has thinner pulp.
In India, the fresh mature fruit is known as khajur or pind khajur, while the dry
form is called chuara. Fruits of chuara are up to 5 cm long, about 1 cm thick,
cylindrical with slightly broad base, tapering towards the stalk end, brownish and
wrinkled. The dry pulp, which is leathery and sweet, encloses the stone. The dry date
palm is considered auspicious in marriage ceremonies and is given with milk on the
nuptial night. It is considered essential for some religious functions. In Muslims, if the
real date palm is not available, they make a sweetmeat with fat, sugar, and wheat
ﬂour in the shape of date palm and call it chuara, for breaking the fast of Ramdzan.
Mahatama Gandhi used date palm soaked in water, for breakfast as part of his diet.
The Indian date has the same but inferior effect.
In Indian commerce, three grades of dry date palm are recognized:
1. Sakariya (sugary) from Iraq and Muscat. It is considered the best.
2. Chupchap from Basra (Iraq). It is intermediate in quality.
3. Zharakhlati. It is of inferior grade.

USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
It is considered cooling in effect. (There is controversy amongst Ayurvedic scholars
about the nature of the date. Some of them consider it to be hot in effect while others
argue, since it is consumed by the people of hot areas (Arab deserts), if it had a hot
effect it would not have been possible for Arabs to digest this fruit.)
The other uses of date palm fruits are:

Chuara 103

As a general tonic
It is a demulcent, expectorant, nutrient, emetic, laxative, aphrodisiac, good for heart
and satisfying (keeps contented). It increases vital ﬂuids, strength and is prescribed for tuberculosis, gastroenteritis, dryness of mouth, coughs, respiratory diseases,
unconsciousness, diseases due to alcoholism, asthma, chest complaints, fevers and
gonorrhea. It is given wherever there is a loss of vital body energy, for general weakness, high blood pressure and fatigue. For physiological strength 10–15 pieces of
dates (or as per the digestive capacity of an individual), should be chewed slowly,
followed by milk. It not only makes the body strong but gives the skin a lustrous
and healthy look. It prevents premature greying of hair and wrinkle formation. It
probably has an anabolic and hormonal effect on the body. It increases vital energy
so is given to physically weak children, adults and expectant mothers for strength,
as follows.
I. Boil 25 g date pulp in 250 ml milk, until the pulp is soft. Both the date and
milk are consumed. Some people add a pinch of saffron to milk before boiling it.
II. In the morning, when the stomach is empty, and before sleep in the evening,
take two dry dates daily for the ﬁrst two weeks, increase the dose to three in the third
week and four pieces in the fourth week onwards. Do not eat more than four dates at
one time. Follow this regime for at least three months. After this period boil dates in
milk before use.

For infants
During teething trouble, date is given to infants for chewing. It hardens the gums and
is also a mild laxative.

For sexual weakness
Remove the stone from date, replace with 4–5 pieces of saffron and tie the fruit with
thread in such a way that saffron does not escape from inside. Boil the date in 250 ml
of milk until it is reduced to half. Macerate the date in this condensed milk and
discard milk-insoluble part. Drink by chewing the milk slowly. It invigorates the
sexual systems of both sexes.

For asthma
Chew two dry dates in the morning every day. It gives strength to the lungs, and the
body becomes immune to cold and allergies.

For colds
After two days of a cold attack, take four pieces of fresh date. Boil the minced pulp of
these dates with four seeds of black pepper and one cardamom in 250 ml of milk.
After brisk boiling, add one teaspoon of ghee. Chew and swallow the contents and
drink the milk afterwards. This preparation not only cures colds, but if used for 3–4
nights, it helps headaches, heavy heads, dry coughs, lethargy, mild fever and loss of
appetite.

104 Chuara

Ayurvedic preparation
Cold drink
Date has been considered as an antifatigue and a thirst quencher. In Ayurvedic work
Sarangdhara a recipe for a cold drink made from the infusion of equal parts of date,
dry pomegranate seed (sour variety which grows wild in the western Himalayas), black
grape, fruit of Grewia asiatica, tamarind, with salt and spices as per taste, is mentioned.

Chemical studies
The fruit contains protein (1.2 per cent), fat (0.4 per cent), carbohydrate (33.8 per
cent), ﬁbre (3.7 per cent), and the minerals calcium (1.7 per cent) and phosphorus (1.7
per cent).

Draksha 105

19 Draksha

Vitis vinifera L.
Family: Vitaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a climber with broad leaves, now cultivated in most of the temperate parts of the
world. There are many varieties of grapes, but in Ayurveda dry, big, black grapes with
seed are mainly used.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Black grape is considered a nutritive, energizer, anti-inﬂammatory, diuretic, laxative
and bronchiodilater. It is an important ingredient of most fermented Ayurvedic preparations (asav and arishta).
Medicated wine from grapes
Method Take 1kg black grapes (dry), 1kg sugar, 1kg honey, 125 g Woodfordia fruticosa
and 10 g each of Cinnamomum spp. leaves, cardamom seed, Mesua ferrea, clove, nutmeg,
black pepper, long pepper, Plumbago zeylanica, Piper cubeba, Piper longum root, Piper
chaba and Vitex negundo. Wash grapes and boil them in 5 litres of water until the water
is reduced to one-fourth, macerate the whole mass and ﬁlter through a coarse cloth to
obtain the juice. Dissolve sugar and honey in this juice. Make a coarse powder of all
the herbs and spices given above, mix them in this ﬂuid and store them in a suitable
container for fermentation for 45 days. The earlier method of fermentation was to use
earthen pitchers, covering the mouth of pitcher with an earthen lid, sealed with coarse
cloth followed by a layer of clay, but now for large-scale manufacturing wooden vats
are used.
Dose Two rice/teaspoons with half a cup of water twice daily.
Use It is a nutrient for digestive problems, indigestion, fatigue and ﬂatulence.

106 Draksha
Drakshavleh
Method Take 1kg dry black grapes, 200 g ghee, 2 kg sugar and 15 g each of nutmeg,
mace, cardamom, bamboo manna (silicic acid), Mesua ferrea and 3 g saffron. Macerate
the grapes after soaking them in water for one hour, heat them with ghee on a slow ﬁre.
Make a sugar syrup and add it to these heated grapes, followed by ﬁne powder of all
the herbs. Add water and allow the whole mixture to ferment for 45 days.
Dose 10–20 ml with milk twice daily.
Use

As a nutrient, in hyperacidity, constipation and cirrhosis of liver.

Draksharishta
The formulation of Draksharishta varies slightly as compared to Drakshasavleh and
both of these can be substituted for each other.
Method: 1 kg dry black grapes, 4 kg raw sugar, 150 g Woodfordia ﬂowers, and 20 g
each of Embelia ribes, long pepper, cinnamon, cardamom seed, Cinnamomum spp. leaves,
ginger, Mesua ferrea and black pepper. Follow the process of Drakshasavleh.
Use: As a laxative, for mental, physical fatigue and insomnia. It provides immediate
energy to the body. It is of use to women for excessive bleeding during menstruation,
leucorrhoea, etc.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Procyanidins from seed have an antimutagenic effect which counteracts spontaneous
mutation of Sacharomyces cerevisiac both at mitochondrial and nuclear level (Liviero
et al. 1994). Due to the antioxidant properties of procyanidins, it has potential use for
the chemoprevention of several pathological situations.
On the combined basis of a large number of epidemological and clinical studies it
was concluded that wine phenolics can reduce heart diseases and mortality (Waterhouse,
1995). This nutritional and pharmacological signiﬁcance may be due to ﬂavonoids
(epicatechin, malvidin 3 glucosides, quercetin and procyanidins).

Gaduchi 107

20 Gaduchi

Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers ex Hook.f. and Thomas
T. malabarica (Lam.) Miers
Family: Menispermaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is often substituted by other wild or cultivated species of Tinospora. It is a household
remedy, known as giloe, in most parts of India. Giloe climbing on Azadirachta indica
tree, known as neem, is considered superior and is called neem giloe. It is said that,
through its contact with the neem tree, it is able to absorb the therapeutic active
constituents from it.
The plant (Fig. 11A) is a liana or a climber with a 1–3 cm thick stem and
rough, corky bark. Leaves are glabrous, cordate, 5–10 cm wide, acute or acuminate.
Male and female plants are separate. The ﬂowers are small, yellow green in colour.
The male ﬂowers are in fascicles, while females are solitary. The fruit is red when
ripe.
The green stem or small dry pieces (Fig. 11B), about 2–5 cm long, are used as
medicine but the fresh stem is preferred. The dry pieces have an outer papery skin,
brownish wrinkled surface and numerous pores along the sides. It has a bitter, mucilaginous taste.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda it is called Amrita (nectar). The herb is considered bitter, hot in effect,
nutritive and a rasayana. The major uses of this herb are:

As a Rasayana
a The juice is given with honey or raw sugar.
b Boil 10 g of paste of gaduchi with 10 g Hemidesmus indicus in 100 ml of water, in a
covered pan for two hours on a low heat. Macerate the herbs in hot water and ﬁlter.
The dose is 5–10 ml, three times a day. This decoction is a good diuretic and Rasayana.
It is administered for leprosy, in the second stage of syphilis and to convalescent
patients after chronic diseases to combat the disease.

Figure 11 Tinospora cordifolia A twig, B stem pieces.

For urinogenital diseases
In sexually transmitted diseases, and in diabetes, etc., the herb’s juice or powder is
prescribed.

For malfunctioning of liver
The decoction of the herb with long pepper and honey is prescribed for lack of
appetite due to malfunctioning of liver, and in high fevers. In cirrhosis, jaundice,

Gaduchi 109
indigestion, vomiting, mild stomach-ache, about 10 ml juice of the herb is given with
honey.

For skin diseases
In both chronic and obstinate types, it is given along with Commiphora, Azadirachta,
Emblica, turmeric and Acacia nilotica.

For menstruation problems
In South India, stem pieces are boiled in 2 cups of water and drunk during irregular
and excessive menstruation.

T. crispa
In Indonesia, it is used for malaria, small pox, as a vermifuge, an appetizer, for cholera
and for diabetes mellitus (Cavin et al. 1998).

Ayurvedic preparations

110 Gaduchi
due to diabetes and arthritic pains. It is useful for convalescing patients who are weak
due to fevers. It protects the liver from jaundice and other diseases.
Pit shamak Rasayana churn
Method Pulverize equal quantities of powders of Tinospora, Pedalium murex, Emblica
ofﬁcinalis and sugar.
Dose One teaspoonful with ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and two hours
after meals before retiring.
Use It helps ﬂatulence, hyperacidity, urinogenital diseases, polyurea, diabetes and
sexual inadequacies. It is particularly useful as an antidote to toxins present in the
body after the cure of sexually transmitted diseases.
Gaduchi satva
Method It is a starch obtained from the plant by chopping and crushing twigs about
2 cm thick and immersing them in water. The crushed pieces are macerated by hand
to separate the starch from the ﬁbres. The starch settles down after some time. The
water is decanted and the starch dried.
This starch is said to be highly nutritive and is given to patients of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, in seminal weakness and as a rejuvenator in general debility. Two
grams of this starch with milk is given for burning urethras, following the passing of
urine, and for urinary obstruction (enlarged prostate).
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Anti-microbial property
The alkaloid berberine has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and anti-protozoal
properties.

Anti-ulcerogenic effect
Three indigenous preparations containing gaduchi had anti-ulcerogenic effect (Biswas
et al. 1993). Sarma et al. (1995b) conﬁrmed this activity.

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
Shah and Pandya (1976) observed anti-inﬂammatory effects in the aqueous extract.
Mhaiskar et al. (1976), after clinical evaluation, noted that about half the patients of
arthritis and body pain received relief from this herb. Pendse et al. (1977) found antiinﬂammatory and immunosuppressive effects in the water extract of neem giloe. Oral or
intraperitoneal administration of water extract of the herb signiﬁcantly inhibited acute

Gaduchi 111
inﬂammatory response. It also had an analgesic effect. It potentiated morphine but had
no antipyretic effect. When Kishore et al. (1980) tried ginger with gaduchi in rheumatism and arthritis, the results were comparable with the other Ayurvedic preparations.
Gulati et al. (1980) used this herb in rheumatoid arthritis. Gulati and Pandey (1982)
conﬁrmed its anti-inﬂammatory activity. Ansari and Gaur (1983) observed that gaduchi
directly affects the metabolic activity of body and regulates heart beat. It helps in
chronic and acute inﬂammation and rheumatism. When 22 sufferers of rheumatoid
arthritis were treated with water extract of the herb, there was a signiﬁcant improvement.
Amrutadiguggulu containing Tinospora with Commiphora gave good results in rheumatic
patients (Deshmukh and Ranade 1995).

As a hepatoprotective agent
The herb prevented ﬁbrous changes and regeneration of parenchymal tissue in albino
rats (Rege et al. 1984). It caused modulation of immunosuppression in obstructive
jaundice. The water extract 100 mg/kg for seven days improved cellular immune
functions and the mortality rate of the rats was signiﬁcantly reduced to 16.67 per cent
(Rege et al. 1989). Peer et al. (1990) found this herb was quite effective in proper liver
function in goats. T. cordifolia decoction showed improvement and regeneration of
hepatic cells. Reddy et al. (1993) conﬁrmed this activity.

Anticancerous activity
The effect of T. cordifolia on the functions of macrophages obtained from mice treated
with the carcinogen ochratoxin A was investigated by Dhuley (1997). It decreased the
chemotactic activity of murine macrophages and the production of interlukin and
tumour necrosis factor.

Hypoglycaemic effect
Wadood et al. (1992) observed this activity in leaf extract. Prasad et al. (1992) studied
hypoglycaemic and anti-hyperglycaemic effects of the extract. It showed synergistic
effect with insulin, tolbutamide and propranol. A signiﬁcant fall in glycaemic levels in
rats with glucose-induced hyper-glycaemia occurred. It showed anti-hyperglycaemic
effect in moderate alloxan diabetic rats but it was not effective in severe cases.
Noor and Ashroft (1989) and Cavin et al. (1998) noted that T. crispa aqueous extract
exhibited hypoglycaemic activity in moderately diabetic rats. After two weeks of the
treatment there was an improvement in glucose tolerance and an increase in plasma
insulin levels, which showed improvement in diabetic conditions by virtue of its
action on endocrine pancreas.
A polyherbal patent preparation containing gaduchi was also found effective in
pancreatic islet superoxide dismutase activity in hyperglycaemic rats (Bhattacharya
et al. 1997).

Immunomodulater activity
Dhanukar et al. (1988) studied the effect of this herb on the immunotherapeutic
modiﬁcation of abdominal sepsis induced by caecal ligation. The protective effect of

112 Gaduchi
pre-treatment with T. cordifolia against mixed abdominal infection was also studied.
This pre-treatment reduced the mortality rate, which was comparable to metrinidazole
and gentamycin. It also caused localization of infection. There was an increase in the
peripheral neutrophil count and peritoneal macrophages, which was associated with
increased phagocytic activity of macrophages. Pendse et al. (1977) and Rege et al.
(1989) recorded immunosuppression activity. Deshmukh and Usha (1994) noted the
potent immunostimulant activity in it. Tinospora stimulated percentage phagocytosis
in neutrophils in a dose dependent fashion. Usha et al. (1994) postulated that
immunomodulating potential produced leucocytosis in treated animals and protected
them against experimental models of infection. The herb produced a dose dependent
increase in bone marrow proliferation. Pokharankar and Nagarkatti (1994) observed
modulation of alveolar macrophage function in tuberculosis. Koti et al. (1994) studied
it in immunotherapy of multiple organ dysfunction in obstructive jaundice to bolster
the defence and to decrease the incidence of septicaemia. It resulted in increased survival
of patients. In experimental rats T. cordifolia 100 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks decreased
renal damage, improved the ﬁbrinogen level and reduced lead acetate-induced endotoxaemia. It decreased renal ischaemia-induced mortality. The herb increased the number
and function of neutrophils and monocyte macrophages. Dhawale (1994) studied the
immunostimulant effect of the herb on T-lymphocytes by carrying out a thymocyte
count. It was observed that pre- and post-treatment with Tinospora attenuated the
lymphopenic effect of steroids and hastened the regeneration of thymocytes. Maurya
et al. (1996) conﬁrmed immunostimulant action of the herb.

As an anti-stress agent
The herb helped in stress-induced gastric damage (Tillu et al. 1994). Sipahimalani
et al. (1994) isolated the adaptogen compounds to combat stress. Sarma et al. (1995a,
1996) studied the effect of 100 mg/kg of ethanol extract of Tinospora orally for 16 days
on brain neurotransmitters in stressed rats.
A polyherbal preparation from Rauvolﬁa serpentina, Nardostachys jatamansi and Tinospora
cordifolia was evaluated by Rani and Naidu (1998), for clinical efﬁcacy and safety on
the patients of insomnia by subjective and polysomnographic methods. The results
were encouraging.

As an anti-allergic agent
The aqueous extract of the herb had this effect. It signiﬁcantly decreased bronchiospasms,
capillary permeability and reduced the number of disrupted mast cells in a number of
animals (Nayampalli et al. 1988).

Antioxidant effects
Three compounds isolated from T. crispa exhibited antioxidant and radical scavenging
properties (Cavin et al. 1998).

Anti-endotoxic property
Jayle et al. (1994) carried out these studies.

Gaduchi 113

Diuretic effect
Oke et al. (1977) observed that it produced marked diuretic effect in rats and dogs and
altered sodium, potassium and chlorine levels in urine.

Reviews
Sharma and Khosa (1993) reviewed chemistry and pharmacology and Pathak et al.
(1995) reviewed a chemistry and biological activity. Siddiqui and Zafar (1995)
reviewed phytochemical, pharmacological analysis and the formulations containing
Tinospora.

Chemical studies
The plant contains quarternary alkaloids, such as protoberberine bases, palmatine,
berberine, jattorrhizine and choline, phenylpropene, etc. (Bisset and Nwaiwu, 1983).

116 Gokshru

21 Gokshru

Tribulus terrestris L.
Family: Zygophyllaceae
The herb is known as gokshru (go is cow and kshru hoof ) in Sanskrit because of the
shape of each of the fruit’s cocci, which resemble the hoof of a cow. The corrupted
form of this name in Indian languages is gokhru. In the western countries it is commonly known as Puncture Vine or Caltrop fruit.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a prostate spiny, hairy herb (Fig. 12A) with yellow ﬂowers. Leaves are 2–4 cm
long, paripinnate, with 6–10 oblong leaﬂets. The fruit is hemi-spherical, breaking
into ﬁve cocci, with two types of spine: bigger and smaller. Sometimes the smaller
spines are quite inconspicuous. Each cocci has ﬁve seeds (Fig. 12B). The seed is quite
hard and woody but can be powdered easily. The powder is starchy and has a pleasant
smell.
Tribulus terrestris is often called small gokhru and Pedalium murex (Fig. 12C) is known
as big gokhru because its seeds are bigger (Fig. 12D). Whereas T. terrestris grows on dry
and arid land, P. murex is found growing in dry and hot coastal areas.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The fruit is mainly used as a single entity in various recipes, whereas the root is an
ingredient of a preparation called Dashmul (see amalaki). In Ayurveda, the fruit is
considered to be cooling in effect, having diuretic, tonic and aphrodisiac properties.
It is mainly used in the form of an infusion for painful micturition, calculus affections,
urethral discharges, impotence, gout, kidney diseases and kidney stones. Plant and
dry spiny fruits are also used for spermatorrhea, phosphaturia, urinary incontinence,
Bright’s disease, nephritis and inﬂammation of the kidney. It has a diuretic effect
similar to buchu and uva-ursi. It is mainly used for diseases of the urinogenital system
as follows:
1

In impotence, the plant is boiled until mucilaginous and mixed with Hyoscyamus
and opium.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As an anabolic agent
Some of the studies have indicated that Tribulus caused a 50 per cent increase in
testosterone levels and improved reproductive function. The active constituents of the
fruit had a stimulating effect on immune, sexual and reproductive systems, with
improved muscle building, stamina and endurance. It also caused a reduction in
cholesterol. It altered moods and imparted a feeling of well-being. Tribulus as a liver
tonic breaks down the cholesterol and fats that inhibit healthy liver function. The
cholesterol and fats are converted to hormones and energy, resulting in increased
performance and stamina, which is very beneﬁcial to body builders. It also causes a
positive nitrogen balance and early recovery from muscular stress.

Diuretic activity
Earlier, diuretic activity of the herb was considered to be due to the nitrates present in
it, but it may also be due to alkaloids (Santha and Iyer (1967). Deepak Prakash et al.
(1985) and Singh et al. (1991) conﬁrmed the diuretic activity of the herb. Tribulus
alkaloid (harmine) increased blood pressure and renal perfusion.
Varunadi kwath, a decoction made from Crataeva religiosa, Tribulus, ginger, Bergenia
ligulata, Woodfordia fruticosa and raw sugar, was given to patients with urinary
complaints. Excellent results were obtained in 64 per cent cases (Suru and Kulkarni,
1991).

Nephroprotective potential
Simultaneous administration of 200 mg/kg/day of Tribulus extract and gentamycin
to female rats decreased gentamycin-induced renal damage in both structural and
functional terms. The effect was comparable to verpamil (Nagarkatti et al. 1994).

Antiurolithic effect
Various extracts of the herb showed signiﬁcant dose-dependent protection against
urolith, induced by glass bead implantation in albino rats. It also protected leucocytosis
and elevation in serum urea levels. The anti-urolithic activity appeared to be due to
the combined effects of several constituents present in the extracts (Anand et al. 1994).
The therapeutic response of aqueous extract on hyperoxaluria in male adult rats was
studied by Sangeeta et al. (1993). After 24 hours urinary oxalate excretion reversed to
normal. These authors (Sangeeta et al. 1994) studied oxalate metabolism further and
postulated that normalization of kidney LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) feeding was
mainly due to increases in the LDH5 fraction as the LDH1 remained unchanged in
the groups. It decreased the activities of glycolate oxidase and glycolate dehydrogenase
in liver, but the activity of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase was unaltered. The ethanol
extract was tested for experimentally induced urolithiasis in albino rats. It exhibited
dose-dependent anti-urolithiatic activity and almost completely inhibited stone formation. Other biochemical parameters in urine and blood serum and the histopathology

Gokshru

121

of the urinary bladder, which were altered during the process of stone formation, were
also normalized by the plant extract (Anand et al. 1994).

As a sexual stimulant
A new preparation Tribestan had a stimulative effect on the sexual system. The active
components are steroidal saponins of furostanoic type (Tomova, 1987). Oral administration of saponin terrestrioside F in male rats increased libido and sexual response. In
females the compound potentiated oestrus and increased fertility (Anon., 1992).

Effect on cardiovascular system
The aqueous extract had a potent stimulant effect on heart muscles in a hypodynamic
state (Seth and Jagadeesh, 1976). The aqueous extract, the ethanol water extract 30
per cent, and ethanol extract of the fruit produced hypotensive effect in anaesthetized
animals (Anon., 1977). The total steroidal sapogenins have shown antisclerotic properties (Schreter, 1980). The alkaloid produced a slight rise in blood pressure and an
increase in kidney secretions. When coronary heart disease patients were treated with
saponins, the total efﬁcacious rate of remission in angina pectoris was 82.3 per cent.
The saponins dilated coronary arteries, improved coronary circulation and had the
effect of improving ECG of myocardial ischaemia. It had no adverse effect on renal,
blood or hepatic systems and thus is a drug of choice to treat angina pectoris (Bowen
et al. 1990).

Effect on central nervous system
The activity of alkaloid is α-adrenergic, β-adrenergic and papaverine-like (Noogi et al.
1977). When 20 mg/kg of the drug was administered to rats, there was a sign of CNS
excitation, characterised by increase in spontaneous motility, excitability and restlessness (Deepak Prakash et al. 1985).

As a hepatoprotective agent
Tribulus provided hepatoprotection to primary cultured hepatocytes (Lee et al. 1992).
The compounds isolated from the herb signiﬁcantly prevented cell death induced by
α-galactosamine, tumour necrosis factor ( Jian Xin Li, 1998).

Antibacterial activity
The extract of the herb inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli
(Anon., 1977).

Chemical studies
Quite a number of steroidal sapogenins have been reported. The important ones are
diosgenin, hicogenin, ruscogenin, yamogenin, epismilagenin, tigogenin, neotigogenin,
gitogenin and neogitogenin (Mahato et al. 1978, Miles et al. 1994). Five new steroidal
saponins (terrestrosins A-E) were isolated by Wang Yan et al. (1996).

122 Gokshru

Toxicological studies
Due to grazing on the herb Tribulus, a disease called geeldikkop, which causes photosensitivity, has been reported in sheep (Miles et al. 1994). No such toxicity has been
reported from the various experiments carried out in India.

Substitutes
Pedalium murex L.
It is known as big gokhru in commerce and is used in place of T. terrestris.
An infusion of the fresh herb, 1 part in 20 parts of water, dose 500 ml, is given
daily in cases of spermatorrhoea and nocturnal emission. A decoction of dry fruit is
used when the fresh plant is not available. Fresh leaves and young shoots, kept for a
few minutes in boiling milk, give it a bitter taste and renders it mucilaginous. The
milk so obtained is used as an aphrodisiac and is advised in sexual debility.
Tribulus alatus Del.
The fruit of this herb, which is pear-shaped winged, with two seeds, is known as
Gokhru Kalan.

124 Guggal

22 Guggal

Commiphora wightii (Arn.) Bhandari
Syn. C. mukul (Hook. ex Stocks) Engl.,
Balsamodendron roxburghii Stocks
Family: Burseraceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a woody shrub (Fig. 13A) up to 2 m tall with knotty, crooked, spiny, brown
branches, growing in hot rocky areas of Indian deserts and adjoining areas in Pakistan.
Leaﬂets 1–3, rhomboid-ovate serrate. Flowers are brownish red in fasciles of 2–3.
There are 8–10 stamens which alternate between long and short, and are half the size
of the petals. There are 8–10 lobed discs and the ovary is oblong-ovoid. The fruit is a
red drupe, 6–8 mm in diameter.
For medicinal purposes oleo-gum resin (Fig. 13B) is used. It is exuded from the
plant in winter or is collected by making cuts or by removing bark at some places.
It is a lustrous pale brown, semi-solid mass. Application of inorganic acids to the stem
increases the yield of gum but the plant dies after this treatment because of dehydration.
The quality of the gum depends on its colour and on the amount of foreign organic
and inorganic matters present in it. The fresh good quality guggal is sticky, lustrous,
yellowish, sweet smelling (cedarwood-like), where as old guggal is dull in colour,
brownish black. The lump of gum, which has a greenish hue and superﬁcially resembles the eye of a buffalo, is considered the best. The other grades of the gum are
brownish with some wood chips, while inferior gum is a mixture of dirt and rocks.
Earlier, the low-grade gum was used as ﬂoor plaster. The genuine gum can be differentiated from its common substitute salai guggal by ﬂame test. Guggal near a ﬂame
bulges like a balloon and bursts, but salai guggal burns immediately. When macerated
in water, guggal forms greenish white emulsion.

Puriﬁcation of Guggal
As far as possible only fresh guggal should be used. For incorporation into herbal
formulations, it is puriﬁed and cleaned to remove foreign organic and inorganic matters like pieces of wood, bark, stone, sand and soil. Various methods are followed for
this purpose but usually the gum is put into a bag of thick coarse cloth and boiled in
an aqueous medium such as pure water, cow’s urine, decoction of Triphala or other

Guggal 125

Figure 13 Commiphora wightii A twig, B gum.

herbs. Boiling is continued until the guggal turns soft. On a separate table, a wooden
board is smeared with ghee and the molten gum is spread on the board with a spatula.
All impurities are picked out by hand and the gum is allowed to dry in the air. The
dried gum is fried in ghee and is powdered for medicinal purposes. In another method,
a decoction is prepared from equal quantities of coarse powders of Triphala and Tinospora,
with milk. The decoction is ﬁltered to remove water insoluble matter. Raw guggal
is put into a cloth bag and this bag is allowed to hang in this boiling decoction.
Occasionally the cloth bag is pressed with big wooden spatula to extract molten guggal
from the bag. When nearly all of the molten guggal has come out, the bag is discarded.
The mixture of decoction and extracted guggal is heated further, in the presence of
ghee, until dry. In south India (Shanavaskhan et al. 1997), crude gum is boiled in water
containing 3 parts of Azadirachta leaves and one part of freshly harvested untreated
turmeric (normally turmeric is boiled and dried before storage). The mixture is ﬁltered
through cheesecloth and the ﬁltrate heated further until no water is left. The resulting
gum residue is fried in ghee or castor oil and used. All these treatments cause the loss
of essential oil, which has a therapeutic activity, so a better method is to ﬁrst sort the
gum by hand and then macerate it in hot ghee.

USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Guggal has been mentioned in Atheraveda and in most of the other ancient Ayurvedic
works. It is considered dry, pungent, aromatic, a Rasayana, anti-tridosha, nutritive,

126 Guggal
lubricant for the body systems, stimulant and digestant. This gum is so important in
Ayurveda that it constitutes a separate group of preparations under the general name
guggal in materia medica. It is not possible to mention the details of all these so only
selected uses are given here.

For rheumatism
As per Ayurveda, gum guggal acts as an anti-inﬂammatory agent for all types of pains
in the body because of its hot effects, particularly rheumatism, called amavata in
Ayurveda. Ama is produced by improper digestion and metabolism and gets lodged
in the joints to produce inﬂammation and pains. Usually the patients with diet
irregularity and constipation are affected by amavata. To counteract it, a polyherbal
and polymineral preparation Mahayograja guggal is often prescribed for these purposes,
but it has been observed that Simhanda guggal is more useful for the patients suffering
from constipation. If it causes a burning sensation then the dose may be reduced. If
there is constipation, then a mild laxative like castor oil may be prescribed along with
the pills.

For liver problems
Because of its dry nature guggal helps in sluggish liver.

For malaria
It helps in fever, when accompanied by shivering.

As an aphrodisiac
This effect, is probablys due to its power to dissolve fat from the arteries, which
allow free ﬂow of blood to sexual parts, and thus helps impotence, and in vaginal
diseases.

For bronchial troubles
This effect is due to the gum’s pungency and hotness. In chronic cases of bronchitis
and in tuberculosis it dissolves sputum and clears the throat. Ten grams of a preparation made from equal quantities of long pepper, Adhatoda leaves, honey and ghee is
prescribed for these purposes.

For cardiac problems
It is used for heart diseases, blood pressure problems , anaemia and other diseases of
the blood, normally along with pushkarmul.

As a diuretic
Through its diuretic effect, it dissolves kidney stones.

Guggal 127

For digestive problems
In indigestion, diarrhoea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, inﬂammation of the intestine, it
acts as an intestinal antiseptic. It may be mixed with an equal quantity of aloe extract
to make a dose of 5 g.

For sexually transmitted diseases
It reduces the inﬂammation of the urinogenital tract. In gonorrhoea, it is given with
Hemidesmus indicus, and in syphilis with Tinopsora.

For fractures
Pills made with equal quantities of this gum and shilajit (a bituminous herbo-mineral
compound) are prescribed during fractures. A plaster of the gum is applied externally.

In gynaecological practices
It has a beneﬁcial effect on the female reproductive system. In general practice,
pills made with gum guggal along with the extract of aloe and ferrous sulphate
are given. In sterility due to leucorrhoea, guggal with Berberis extract is a drug of
choice.

For skin diseases
In all types of skin diseases of unknown aetiology, a dose of 25–200 mg of gum guggal
has been found to impart lustre to the skin, giving it a healthy look. It has given good
results even in leprosy.

External applications
Because of anti-inﬂammatory, antiseptic and healing properties, external application
of gum is useful in arthritis, rheumatic pains and piles. A gargle of alcoholic extract of
the gum in water is effective for all mouth and throat problems, such as ulcers,
inﬂammation, tonsillitis, dental caries and pyorrhoea. A drop of the gum in the mouth
is also used as a lozenge.
It is an anti-microbial and deodorant, so it is used as a fumigant in obstinate ulcers
and in chronic septic cases.

Contraindications
While using guggal preparations, avoid acidic foods, strong medicines, alcohol, heavy
exercises, sunbathing, anger and sexual intercourse.

Side effects
It may cause rashes in some cases.

128 Guggal
If not used in a proper way, it has a deleterious effect on the liver and lungs. Its
use can cause excessive dryness of the body, impotence, giddiness and laziness. If any
of these conditions exist then this gum should not be used for these and other related
diseases.

Mahayograj Guggal or its simpler form, Yograja Guggal, are manufactured by a large
number of pharmacies. The ingredients and the quantities of the raw materials in
these products vary in each case so Arora et al. (1973) prepared a standardized Yograja
Guggal, as per classical Ayurvedic method, and tested it against arthritis produced by
various agents. This product was not signiﬁcantly effective. The various commercial
products sold in the market were much less active compared with the standardized
ones. Autarkar et al. (1984) studied side effects and tolerability of Yogaraj Guggal.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As a hypolipidaemic agent
Keeping in view the importance of guggal in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia, after interpreting the ancient texts, extensive studies were carried out in Benaras Hindu University,
Varanasi in India by Satyawati (1969, 1988) and others. It was seen that in Sushsrut
Sanhita, it has been given for aetiology, pathogenesis, treatment of obesity, associated
lipid disorders and the complications arising due to them. On the basis of this information, gum guggal was screened for possible hypolipidaemic, obesity and hypercholesterolaemic effects. It was seen that it protected animals against cholesterol-induced
atheroscelerosis. It reduced the body weight. When patients of various illnesses were
administered 6–12 g of raw gum guggal in three divided doses for 15–30 days, there
was a fall in serum cholesterol. The oral administration of crude guggal, the alcohol
soluble and insoluble fractions brought about a fall in serum cholesterol and serum
turbidity (high serum turbidity is associated with hypercholesterolaemia) due to steroids (Malhotra et al. 1970). The effect of crude guggal on serum lipids in obese bodies
was studied by Kuppurajan et al. (1973). When used for three months it brought
about a signiﬁcant decrease in mean serum cholesterol levels. A patented preparation
of guggal was found to be effective in obesity (Varadani, 1973). The petroleum ether
extract of guggal prevented hyperlipidaemia caused by oestrogen. It did not allow the
synthesis of fats in the body so body weight was reduced and amount of blood lipids
became less. Histological changes indicated enhance activities in the thyroid. On the
basis of this study Gupta et al. (1974) concluded that guggal was a good therapeutic
agent to prevent and treat hyperlipidaemia and adiposity associated with oestrogen
hyperactivity and with hypothyroidism. Tripathi et al. (1975) observed that the active

130 Guggal
principles of the gum showed regression of hyperlipidaemia. Guggal in general reduced
body weight in the obese objects. The feeding of oleoresin to cholesterol-fed rats
enhanced the faecal excretion of bile acids, with an increase in cholesterol excretion
(Sidhu et al. 1976). Gupta et al. (1978) assessed the hypocholesterolaemic and hypolipidaemic effects of the gum in patients suffering from lipid disorders. Singh et al. (1983)
studied the effect of ether extract on experimental hypothyroidism by melatonin.
It increased the weight and iodine uptake of the thyroid gland. Kotiyal et al. (1985)
tried a fraction of the gum for obesity. Agrawal et al. (1986) and Gopal et al. (1986)
carried out clinical trials of gugulipid (guggalsterone) isolated from gum guggal by
ethyl acetate, in primary hypolipidaemia. According to Satyawati (1988) this fraction
lowered serum lipids including cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid when tried
on various animals and human beings. It protected LDL against the depletion of
lipid constituents such as cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids as well as the
conversion of cholesterol into oxygenated cholesterol. This protective action may be
due to its free radical scavenging properties. This compound signiﬁcantly inhibited
the generation of hydoxyl radicals in enzymatic systems. Ahluwalia and Amma (1988)
studied the effects of oral ingestion of the gum and its effect on the faecal excretion of
cholesterol and bile acids in hypo- and hypercholesterolaemic rats. Sharma et al. (1988)
investigated the effect of a mixture of alcohol extract of Triphala and petroleum ether
extract of gum. Verma et al. (1988) tried it in the patients of hyperlipidaemia. Kulkarni
and Paranjape (1990) and Kulkarni (1991) tried a preparation containing guggal
with Triphala and minerals in obesity. Saukhala et al. (1992) used this gum in preventing diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia in rats. Duwiejua et al. (1993) studied antiinﬂammatory activity in the oleoresins of the plant family Burseraceae. Bhatt et al.
(1994) conducted a trial on obese patients by dividing the volunteers into two groups.
One group just conducted standardized physical exercises, while the other group
used guggul preparations whilst carrying out the physical exercises. After the study it
was concluded that guggal has a deﬁnite effect on lowering the body weight. Patel
et al. (1995) tried it in obese patients. Guggulsterone was found to be a potent
hypolipidaemic agent, which prevented oxidation of low density lipoprotein (Kavita
Singh et al. 1997).

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
Chaurasia et al. (1995) carried out research on antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory
properties of the guggal-containing drug. The various uses documented are:
For sciatica Nair et al. (1978), Tyagi and Prasad (1995).
For inﬂammatory pains Purushottam Dev (1979).
For rheumatic arthritis Pandit and Shukla (1981), Shukla et al. (1985), Pandey
and Sharma (1986), Vyas and Shukla (1987) tried pure guggal whilst Majumdar
(1984) used a polyherbal preparation and a guggal preparation containing gold.
Kishore et al. (1987) carried out clinical studies with the preparation Sunthi-guggal
containing Commiphora with ginger. Chandrasekharan et al. (1994) worked on an
Ayurvedic preparation. Sannd and Kumari (1994) used a compound preparation in
osteoarthritis.

Guggal 131
For fractures

Panda (1990) prepared a plaster with lac and guggal.

In cervical spondylitis Mehra and Gurdip Singh (1986).

In heart diseases
Guggal was evaluated for ﬁbrinolytic activity and platelet aggregation in coronary
artery disease (Bordia and Chuttani, 1979, Baldwa et al. 1980), as a cardioprotective
agent in patients of coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (Arora
et al. 1995).
An Ayurvedic preparation Pushkar Guggal, in which guggal is used with Inula
racemosa, was effective as an anti-anginal and hypolipidaemic agent in coronary heart
disease (Singh et al. 1993, Dubey et al. 1995).

In skin diseases
Guggulipid gave good results when taken orally in acne vulgaris (Dogra et al. 1990).

Anthelmintic activity
Kakrani and Kalyani (1984) noted the anthelmintic activity of essential oils. Bagi
et al. (1985) also carried out pharmacological studies on the essential oil.

In leucorrhoea
Rao et al. (1985) used a compound preparation of Phyllanthus emblica and guggal.

In thyroid stimulation
Tripathi et al. (1984), Singh et al. (1985), Tripathi et al. (1988) studied thyroid
stimulation using a constituent obtained from the gum, z-guggalosterone.

In urinary tract infection
Gokshuradi Guggal made from a gum of guggal, Tribulus terrestris and other herbs was
tried in urinary tract infections (Upadhyaya and Singh, 1979).

Review
Kakrani (1981) and Satyawati (1988) has reviewed this drug.

Haritaki 135

23 Haritaki

Terminalia chebula Retz.
Family: Combretaceae
THE TREE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a medium-sized tree with dark brown bark and elliptic oblong, broad leaves
(Fig. 14). The mature fruit is more or less a ﬁve angled drupe, 2.5 to 4 cm long,
usually obovoid and glabrous. The tree grows in the sub-Himalayan tract and in the
deciduous forests of India. It is commonly known by the name harar.
As per Hindu mythology, the tree originated from a few drops of nectar, which fell
from heaven on the ground. Because of this divine origin, it has been given various
names showing its virtues, such as Haritaki – born in the abode of Hara (Lord Shiva)
on Himalayas, Vijaya – victorious or conquers all the diseases, Rohini – heals the
wounds, ulcers, Amrita – nectar, Shakla sreshta – the best of all, Abhya – not fearful of
any diseases, Airytha – cures all diseases, Pramatha – eradicates the disease from the
source, Amogh – always beneﬁcial, Kayastha – sustains the body, Pratpathya – extremely whole some, Divya – divine in nature, Prananda – offering life, Jiva, Jivanti,
Jivanika – life promoting, Putana- sanctifying, Shreyasi – conferring prosperity, Chataki
– increasing vitality, Balyi – gives strength, Jivya priya – liked by all, Bhisak priya –
loved by physicians, Pachoni – digestive.
It has been considered a Rasayana since ancient times. Lord Budha and Guru
Padmasambhav, the great Budhist sage who was instrumental in spreading Budhism
beyond Himalayas, kept this fruit in their laps (Fig. 15). In ancient times the reputation
of this fruit spread from India to the Middle East, and from there to Greece. Kabul
(Afghanistan) became the biggest centre of its trade.
In earlier Ayurvedic texts, seven types of haritaki are mentioned, but now in India
following three types are well known:
1
2

Harar Jangi or Haleileh e Jung or Bal haritaki: It is the immature fruit, black in
colour and smaller in size.
Harar: It is available in different shapes and sizes. It is lustrous brown to
greyish brown in colour. It may be sold as such, but very often the seed
(stone) is separated from the pulp and the dry pulp is sold as chilka (cover)
harar.

136 Haritaki

Figure 14 Terminalia chebula A twig, B young fruit, C dry fruit, D young dried fruit.

3

Harar Kabuli: It is about double the size of common haritaki fruit and is preferred
for Rasayana treatment. It is so heavy that it sinks in water. The name Kabuli
means from Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, which at one time was a big centre
for the trade of this fruit. It is very expensive (more than ten times the price of the
common variety), so it is sometimes adulterated with moulded fruits made from
haritaki powder. Tuber of Exogonium purga Benth. (Ipomoea jalap) which is called
Jalap Harar is a common substitute for this fruit. Jalap tuber not only superﬁcially resembles Kabuli Harada in shape but also in its laxative action. It is a
strong purgative. Jalap Harar is a tuber without a stone so it can be differentiated from Kabuli Harar on the basis of morphological characteristics. It has
striations on the outer surface and its powder causes a strong burning sensation in
the mouth.

Haritaki 137

USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As a good Rasayana it provides nutrition to the body in the same way that a mother
provides to a foetus. The major uses of this fruit are:

As a laxative
In constipation, half a teaspoon of powdered immature fruit with cold water is given
at bedtime. It is not only a good laxative but also regulates bowel movements. It

138 Haritaki
operates rapidly without irritation or heat and can be used for a long time. It has a
beneﬁcial effect on the enlargement of the spleen. If as a result of its administration
the faeces become watery, then the dose is reduced, but if hard, then the dose is
increased. If dry powder is not easy to administer, it is mixed with an equal quantity
of ghee and is given with water or 250 ml of milk. These ﬂuids avoid astringency and
lubricate the alimentary canal. T. chebula is an ingredient of a well-known household
laxative Triphala (p. 28). A preserve called Muraba Harar made by an inﬁltration of
sugar syrup in haritaki is also used as a laxative.

As a Rasayana
Haritaki provides strength to the body and delays the effects of old age. As a Rasayana,
use three grams of harar kabuli powder in the morning when the stomach is empty. In
the ﬁrst half of winter ginger juice is added to haritaki, whilst in the second half long
pepper is used. In the rainy season it is used with salt, in autumn with sugar and in
spring with honey.

As an astringent
Through this activity, it cures spongy gums, ulcers, dysentery and chronic diarrhoea.

Contraindications
It should not be used by lean and thin people, in the case of extreme weakness, by
people with poor digestion, in pregnancy or if there is haemorrhaging in any part of
the body.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As an anti-spasmodic
Chebulin isolated from the fruit, possesses anti-spasmodic activity resembling that of
papaverine (Thakur et al. 1989).

Hypolipidaemic activity
The feeding of a fraction of fruit extract to rats lowered their levels of low density
lipoprotein lipids and increased the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, whilst
reducing hepatic triglyceride (Khanna et al. 1993).

In liver problems
Sohni and Bhatt (1996) tried a compound herbal formulation containing this fruit in
hepatic amoebiasis.

Haritaki 139

As a laxative
Tripathi and Tewari (1983) prescribed haritaki for simple constipation. The results
were excellent in 20 per cent of the patients, and good in the rest. No side effects were
observed in any case. Tamhana and Throat (1994) observed that the fruit affected
gastric motility.

As an immunomodulator
The alcohol extract effectively scavenged the oxygen free radicals. It signiﬁcantly
inhibited chemiluminescence of human leucocyte and the bad effects of cigarette
smoke (Fu Naiwu et al. 1992, Sohni and Bhatt 1996).

Cardiotonic property
Awsathi and Nath (1968) isolated a cardiac glycoside and Reddy et al. (1990) a
phenolic compound responsible for cardiotonic activity. These compounds increased
the force of contraction and cardiac output without altering the heart rate. Chebulinic
acid – a major phenolic glycoside had a pronounced cardiotonic property. Its effect was
greater on a hypodynamic heart than on a normal one. Various extracts from the fruit
rind showed inhibition of Na+, K+, Mg2+ ATPase of frog heart muscle, which were
dose dependent (Azeem et al. 1992). Srivastava et al. (1992), Reddy et al. (1994) also
observed a cardiotonic effect of the fruit.

Cytoprotective effect
It had a cytoprotective effect when used with Asparagus racemosus (Dahanukar et al.
1983). The water extract of the fruit exhibited an anti-mutagenic activity when tested
on Salmonella typhimurium (Grover and Saroj Bala, 1992). Hydrolyzable tannins and
related compounds from the fruit had cytotoxic activity (Lee SeungHo, 1995).

Antimicrobial property
Sato et al. (1997) isolated gallic acid and its ester, which were effective against methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The aqueous extract of the fruit exhibited very strong
anti-viral activity against duck hepatitis B virus and against HIV-1 protease (Xu
Hong Xi et al. 1996, Chung et al. 1997).

In Uraemia
It is rich in tannins and thus has a uraemic toxin decreasing action (Yokozawa et al.
1995).

Chemical studies
The fruit has 30 to 32 per cent tannins and 13.9 to 16.9 per cent non-tannins. The
tannins are of the pyrogallol type, rich in gallic acid, ellagic acid and a glycoside similar
to sennoside. Chebulin and chebulinic acid have also been reported (Thakur et al. 1989).

Ferula foetida Regel
Syn. F. foetida (Bunge) Regel
F. asafoetida L.
F. rubricaulis Boiss
Family: Umbelliferae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a large perennial herb, with a stem 1.5 to 3 m high, 2.5 to 7.5 cm thick, greenish
and furrowed. The leaves are few, radical and cauline, near the stem base (Fig. 16),
imparipinnate, 45 cm long and 10 to 15 cm broad. Flowers are small, monoecious and
yellow. Oleo-gum resin is obtained from F. foetida and other allied species. These
plants grow in western Afghanistan, Iran and adjoining Turkey in mountain slopes,
desolate wastes and sandy deserts.

Collection of oleoresin
The gum resin consists of milky sap, obtained from an incision of the green matured
root. The oldest plants are most productive and a plant less than four years old is
considered virtually worthless. From March to April, just before ﬂowering, the upper
part of the carrot-shaped root is laid bare and the stem is cut off close to the crown.
The exposed surface is covered by a dome-shaped structure made from twigs and earth.
After a few days the exudative is scraped off and a fresh slice of the root is cut to
gather more latex. This process is continued for up to three months until there is no
more exudate. About 1 kg of gum may be obtained from each plant by this process.

The oleoresin
After collection and drying, the dry latex comes in various forms, such as light to dark
brown lumps or a thick paste and is graded for commercial purposes. It has a garliclike smell. It may be powdered either when excessively cold or by drying over freshly
burnt lime or exposure to a current of warm air, then reducing to a low temperature
or diluting with starch or magnesium carbonate (Culbreth, 1927).
In raw form asafoetida is nauseating so it is often fried in ghee before use. In India,
a compound of asafoetida diluted with starch is often used. It is prepared by boiling

142 Hing

Hing 143
asafoetida, starch and water to obtain a gelatinized mass. On cooling small lumps from
this mixture are made and dried. It is sold under the name of Bandhani Hing or may
be powdered. It is a household name in India and is a constituent of most of spice
mixtures used for cooking. Earlier, in some parts of India, for honouring a guest it was
common practice to smear the plate with a paste of asafoetida before serving dinner.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Asafoetida is considered anti-spasmodic and hot in effect. It counteracts convulsions,
paralytic attack, cough spasms and breathing obstructions, nervous irritability, depression and apathy. Because of a strong stimulant effect on the nervous system, it works
as an excellent aphrodisiac. In hysteria it is prescribed with valerian. It is mainly an
ingredient of an Ayurvedic digestive powder Hingvastika churn, used as carminative.

Uses in old western medicine
It was used for hysteria, hypochondriasis, convulsions, spasms, nervous apoplexy, whooping cough and ﬂatulent constipation. Cerebral excitants were considered synergistic
with it, whilst cerebral and arterial depressants were incompatible (Culbreth, 1927). It
was commonly used in the form of tincture or as an emulsion, which was prepared by
gradually triturating 4 g of asafoetida with 90 ml of water. The dose was 15–30 ml.
A pill, made from equal parts of aloe extract and asafoetida, was also very popular for
hyperacidity. With valerian, tincture asafoetida was commonly prescribed as a remedy
for enuresis, hypochondria and hysteria, as it stimulated the general nervous system
and circulation by raising arterial tension. It stimulated secretions and excretions and
increased libido.

Toxicological studies
The raw asafoetida is nauseating due to essential oils, so it is heated before use.

Myristica fragrans Houtt.
Family: Myristicaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is indigenous to Moluccas Island, but grows in Java and Sumatra (Indonesia),
Malaysia and is cultivated to a limited extent in Brazil, Granada, South India and Sri
Lanka at an elevation of 300 m, along the sea coast in the tropical climate (Farrel,
1985). The name nutmeg is misleading as the seed is not a nut. It is a small evergreen
tree, with alternate, oblong ovate, acute, entire, smooth dark green leaves (Fig. 17A).
The ﬂowers are small and pale yellow. The fruit is oval, smooth, lustrous and when the
kernel is cut, dark veins are clearly visible due to the presence of aromatic oils.
The fruit cover is hard, about 2 cm long, oval to ovoid, enclosing mace, which is an
outer covering on the nutmeg seed (Fig. 17B, C, D). On drying it separates from the
seed as an orange-yellow papery material. It is used along with nutmeg in most cases.
The mace is also sold under the name ﬂower of the nutmeg tree (Ratsch, 1997).
Nutmeg has been used in most of the world for its stimulating effect, for its loveinciting property and as an aphrodisiac due to myristicin in its essential oil. The
bigger fruits are preferred for medicinal purposes. Ingestion of several teaspoons of
nutmeg can give mild hallucinogenic experiences, perceptual distortions, euphoria,
mild visual hallucinations and a feeling of unreality. The active compounds myristicin
and elimicin are somewhat like mescaline in action. Myristicin was the starting point
for the love drug MDA or ecstasy. It appears to be transformed in vivo into highly
active amphetamine derivatives (Ratsch, 1997).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The tree is not a native of India but both mace and nutmeg are frequently mentioned
in Ayurvedic literature. It is said to have saffron-like activity. According to Ayurveda,
nutmeg is bitter, pungent, hot in effect, pleasant, light, digestant, anti-kaph and antivata. It helps bronchial troubles, nausea, vomiting and heart troubles. It is used in
delirium tremens, insomnia and senile debility.
Being strong and hot in nature, it has a special effect on the nervous system and
thus helps in sexual inadequacies. It has an irritating effect on the mucous membrane.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As a sedative
Bhagwat and Saiﬁ (1980) studied the pharmacological action of volatile oils. It exhibited a sedative and skeletal muscle depressant effect. It produced a direct relaxant
effect on the smooth muscles of the intestine, which was comparable to that produced
by adrenaline. Shin et al. (1988) isolated a hepatic drug metabolism inhibitor from
nutmeg. It signiﬁcantly prolonged hexobarbital-induced sleeping time. Other tests
conﬁrmed CNS depressant properties in nutmeg.

146 Jaiphal and Javitri

Effects on digestive system
Rashid and Misra (1984) observed that the aqueous extract of the seed’s paste had a
marked inhibitory effect on the antienterotoxigenic effect produced by Escherichia coli.
Shidore et al. (1985) found that the petroleum ether and water extract of nutmeg had
anti-diarrhoeal activity, while the petroleum ether extract, when used alone, had antiinﬂammatory properties. Chabra and Rao (1994) studied changes in the liver enzymatic
system.

Hypolipidaemic effects
Hattori et al. (1993) found that mace had an inhibitory effect on lipids. Alpana Ram
et al. (1996) studied the nutmeg extract for hypolipidaemic effect.

Chemical studies
Mace contains 11–15 per cent essential oil, while nutmeg has 16 per cent. Nutmeg also
contains ﬁxed oil 24–30 per cent of fatty oils, known as nutmeg butter (Farrell, 1985).

Toxicological studies
Hallstrom and Thuvander (1997) carried out a toxicological evaluation of myristicin,
the major component of nutmeg.

Adulterants
M. malabarica is a large tree, growing in South India. It has fruits bigger than nutmeg
but they are not aromatic. Nutmeg is often adulterated or substituted with these seeds.

26 Kabab Chini

Piper cubeba L f.
Family: Piperaceae
It is also known as sheetalchini in commerce. The Sanskrit name is kankol.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It grows wild in Borneo, and on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. It is
cultivated in Sri Lanka and in some parts of Karnataka, in south India. It is a
perennial, woody, evergreen creeper (Fig. 18A) with conspicuous nodes. The leaves are
round to cordate, lanceolate, smooth, leathery, shining, glabrous, 15 cm long, with
conspicuous vein islets. The ﬂower is inconspicuous in 2.5 to 5 cm long bunches. The
fruit is round like black pepper (Fig. 18B) 3–6 mm broad, with a brown to dark
brown pericarp, coarsely reticulate. The fruit has a strong aroma, and characteristically
pungent taste. The fruit is collected when fully developed but unripe.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The drug of commerce is like black pepper. It is round, wrinkled, black with a small
stalk at one end. When chewed it imparts an aroma and a cooling sensation like that
of peppermint. Because of this characteristic it is called sheetal, which means cooling.
It is bitter and pungent, sometimes used alone but often with P. betle leaves or other
ingredients. It is said to increase the sex drive. Cubeba cigarettes are made by taking
two parts P. cubeba, 1 part Datura leaves, 1 part peppermint leaves, and are used as a
mild aphrodisiac and also in acute or chronic bronchitis. A medicated wine can also be
prepared by immersing crushed seed in white wine (Ratsch, 1997).
In Ayurveda, it is considered a stimulant, digestive, diuretic and cardiotonic, having hot effect on the body. It has a strong antiseptic action, so it is used for venereal
diseases. The seed’s paste is applied to aches, pains, and inﬂammation. The oil distilled
from the seed is applied as an antiseptic to wounds. It is particularly useful for mouth
and throat infections.
In western medicine, it was earlier used for gonorrhoea, urethritis, vesical irritability, cystitis, prostate gland, abscesses, piles, chronic bronchitis and catarrh (Culbreth,
1927). The dose was 4–5 g powder and 5–20 drops oil.
It is also used as follows:

27 Kalmegh

Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. ex Nees.
Family: Acanthaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It grows wild as an under-shrub in tropical, moist deciduous forests of India.
It is an annual herb or small shrub, branches are sharply quadrangular, often narrowly winged towards the apical region. Leaves are petiolate, 5–8 cm long, lanceolate
and acute. Flowers are small, solitary in panicle (Fig. 19). Fruits are 20 mm long,
3 mm wide, linear oblong acute at both ends. Seed are numerous, yellowish brown
and glabrous.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
At one time many Swertia spp. (Indian name chirayta) were well esteemed as bitter
tonics. These herbs grew in the temperate Himalayas, but because of over-exploitation
these plants became scarce and hence expensive. Andrographis which has widespread
distribution in India, was found to be a good substitute for Swertia, and it became
popular as Hara (green) chirayta. It is well known as kalmegh in Ayurveda and sometimes as kirayta. It is sold as such in dry form; sometimes the leaves get separated,
exposing the black twigs. Its main uses are as follows:

As a febrifuge
The herb is a bitter tonic and a febrifuge. It was included in the earlier editions of
Indian pharmacopoeia. In Bengal (an Indian State), a preparation called Alui is prepared by taking powder of cumin and the seed of Amomum subulatum in the juice of
this herb. Alui is prescribed for malaria.

For the digestive system
It encourages appetite and aids digestion. It is also used in dysentery, as an anthelmintic,
stomachic, a liver stimulant, choleretic, cholagaogue, for jaundice, hepatotoxicity, etc.
Decoction of the herb has been used for sluggish liver and in a certain form of

152 Kalmegh

dyspepsia, associated with gaseous distension. For children suffering from liver torpidity a dose of 5 g of the herb twice daily is adequate until cured
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Anti-allergic activity
The bitter principles andrographolide and neoandrographolide showed signiﬁcant antiPCA (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) and mast cell stabilizing activities. These activities were comparable to that of cromoglycate (Gupta et al. 1998). Madav et al. (1998)
conﬁrmed the anti-allergic activity of andrographolide. This compound signiﬁcantly decreased degranulation of rat mast cells and reduced its liberation.

Kalmegh 153

Effect on the liver
The action of the herb is entirely on gustatory nerves, resulting in increased ﬂows
of saliva and gastric juices. Handa and Sharma (1990a,b) showed hepatoprotective
activity of andrographolides against galactosamine, paracetamol and carbon tetrachloride-induced intoxication in rats. Andrographolides brought about complete normalization of toxin-induced effects. Sarma and Tripathi (1992) found the herb effective
in viral hepatitis. Andrographolides produced a signiﬁcant dose dependent effect, as
evidenced by increases in bile ﬂow, bile salts and bile acids (Tripathi and Tripathi,
1991, Shukla et al. 1992). Visen et al. (1991, 1992) evaluated the hepatoprotective
activity of andrographolide. These authors (Visen et al. 1992) carried out in vitro
studies by using andrographolide on primary cultured rat hepatocytes. A curative
effect against galactosamine toxicity was found. It protected rat hepatocytes against
paracetamol-induced damage. It was more potent than silymarin, a standard hepatoprotective agent obtained from Silybium marianum. Pretreatment of rats with andrographolide signiﬁcantly prevented the toxic effects of paracetamol, as judged by cell
viability, certain biochemical markers and altered enzyme levels towards normal, which
suggests it acts upon plasma membranes (Visen et al. 1993). The herb was effective
against anti-human immunodeﬁciency virus type I (HIV-I) (Otake et al. 1995).
Alcohol extract of the herb and two of its constituent diterpenes, andrographolide and
neoandrographolide, showed signiﬁcant antihepatotoxic action in Plasmodium bergheiinduced hepatic damage in Mastomys natalensis. These preparations decreased the levels
of liver peroxidation production and facilitated the recovery of superoxide dismutase
and glycogen (Ramesh Chander et al. 1995).
Premila (1995), Bhatt and Bhatt (1996) have reviewed the literature on hepatoprotective effect of Andrographis in vivo, in animal studies, in vitro assays and in clinical
trials.

Anti-ulcerogenic activity
The compound apigenin, isolated from the herb, exhibited dose-dependent anti-ulcer
activity in Shay rats, histamine-induced ulcers in guinea pigs and aspirin-induced
ulcers in rats (Vishwanathan et al. 1981).

Anti-inﬂammatory activity
In induced oedema, the herb gave a mean inhibition percentage of 65.35 per cent,
compared with 76.50 per cent by butazone (Tajudin et al. 1983). Madav et al. (1995)
found analgesic, anti-pyretic and anti-ulcerogenic activity in andrographolides. Madav
et al. (1996), Shukla et al. (1992) noted that the herb had a good effect against all types
of inﬂammatory agents. It also inhibited acetic acid-induced vascular permeability.

Effect on common cold
Hancke et al. (1995) observed this herb had a positive effect on common colds and
sinusitis, with symptomatic relief and reduced duration of symptoms. There was a
reduction in body temperature in 70 of 84 patients. In pharyngo-tonsilitis it was as
effective as acetaminophen. It gave relief to all the patient’s symptoms (Melchior,
1996/97).

154 Kalmegh

Immunostimulant property
Water extract of the herb caused humoral immune response stimulation and cellular
immune response suppression (Sutarjadi et al. 1991, Saxena, 1992). It caused signiﬁcant
stimulation of antibodies and delayed hypersensitivity responses to sheep red blood
cells in mice. It also stimulated non-speciﬁc immune responses. It appears that compounds other than andrographolides in the herb are responsible for this activity (Puri
et al. 1993).

In cardiac diseases
The herb was found to be an effective anti-thrombogenic agent in treating arterial
thrombotic diseases. An anti-platelet aggregation effect on blood samples of volunteers was seen (Huo and Jinzhi, 1989). The ﬂavone extract from the root prevented the
formation of thrombi, as well as the development of myocardial infraction in dogs
(Zhao and Fang, 1991). Andrographis prevented the atherosclerotic arterial stenosis
and restenosis after angioplasty. Hypotensive properties in various fractions have
been observed (Zhang and Tan, 1997; Wang and Zhao, 1997).

In leukaemia
The methanol extract of A. paniculata is reported to cause cell differentiation in mouse
myeloid leukaemia cells. To conﬁrm this Matsuda et al. (1994) isolated various compounds from this herb. Out of three diterpenoids isolated, two new compounds and
andrographolides were found to be active.
CHEMICAL STUDIES
The diterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid compounds have been referred to as
andrographolides.

Toxicological studies
When various concentrations of standardized extracts of herb were used for 60 days
and evaluated using reproductive organ weight, testicular histology, ultra structural
analysis of Leydig’s cells and testosterone levels, no testicular toxicity was found
(Burgos et al. 1997).

Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC
Syn: M. pruiens Bakr.
M. prurita Hook.
Family: Leguminosae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
In India the plant’s range is from the Himalayan foothills to sub-tropical forests.
It is a liana with trifoliate leaves, which may be up to 12 cm long (Fig. 20A). The
inﬂorescence (is) raceme with purple ﬂowers and silky rachis. Pods vary in size
and may be up to 7 cm long and 1 cm broad, curved at one end and covered with
pale brown to steel grey bristles. These bristles cause intense irritation if touched.
During seed collection great care is taken to avoid the pod touching the body.
Some collectors burn the outer bristles to separate the seed from the pods, while
others pluck the pods using a pair of tongs, store the pod in a thick bag, and
separate the seed by beating the bag with a club. The seeds are picked by hand
using a glove. Four distinct types of seed – variegated brown (big) (Fig. 20B),
white (big) (Fig. 20C) dark brown (intermediate size), black (small) (Fig. 20D) – are
available.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As a component of the diet, the beans are soaked in water until they begin to
sprout. They are washed in pure water, boiled or ground to form a paste for
cooking.
For medicinal purposes, the seeds are not used as such but are mitigated before use,
by boiling them in milk and removing the outer seed coat and embryo. The kernel
which is obtained is dried and powdered. The milk in which these seeds are boiled
is considered poisonous and is discarded. In south India (Shanavaskhan, 1997), seeds
are ﬁrst boiled in a solution of buffalo dung. On cooling, the seed coat and embryo
is removed and the resulting kernel is stored in rice gruel, water, yogurt milk or
lime juice for ten days. The seed kernels are washed after this treatment, with lime
juice and dried in sunlight for three days. The common uses of these mitigated seeds
are:

158 Kawanch

Figure 20 Mucuna pruriens A twig, B big seed black, C big seed brown,
× 3/4, D small seed black.

As a dietary supplement
These seeds are considered an aphrodisiac and a nervine tonic. A dietary supplement is
prepared by making small dough cakes of mitigated seeds and milk.

As an aphrodisiac
The seed is used in many aphrodisiac preparations. Some of these are:

Kawanch 159
1 Pulverize equal quantities of Chlorophytum arundinaceum, Tinospora starch, Mucuna,
Hygrophila, Salmalia root, Emblica and sugar. The dose is 5 g, twice daily with
milk, for three months.
2 Take 4 kg Mucuna, 20 litres cow’s milk, 500 g ghee, 10 g each of nutmeg, mace,
Piper chaba, clove, Indian thyme, Anacyclus pyrethrum, Argyreia, ginger, long pepper,
black pepper, Mesua ferea, Cinnamomum spp. leaves, cinnamon, Elettaria, Callicarpa
macrophylla, Scindapsus ofﬁcinalis and 8 kg sugar. Make a ﬁne powder of all the
herbs and spices. Boil Mucuna seed in milk until it condenses to a solid mass.
Roast this solid mass in ghee and add syrup prepared from 8 kg of sugar and mix
all the herbs to it. Make candy balls of 20 g each from this mixture. Take one ball
in the morning on an empty stomach and a second ball two hours after dinner. It
is considered a supreme tonic.
A similar recipe without herbs and spices is called Banar Gutika (Banar is
monkey and gutika pill). It is said that monkeys in jungles consume these seeds
and remain physically and sexually active all the time.
3 Take 50 g of ﬁnely powdered Asparagus, Mucuna, Hygrophila, Withania, Sida spinosa,
Abutilon root, 5 litres milk, 500 g ghee, with almonds, pistachios, pine nuts and
dry grapes as per taste. Treat Mucuna seed with milk and ghee as above. Add the
powdered herbs to the condensed milk and mix in the dry fruits. Make candy balls
of 25–30 g each. Eat one ball at breakfast every day.
4 Take 50 g of ﬁnely powdered Withania, Blepharis edulis, Mucuna, Argyreia, Tribulus,
Hygrophila, Sida cordifolia seed, Abutilon and mix it with 250 g sugar. This mixture
is for middle-aged people, who may take a dose of 10 g mixed in ghee, followed by
milk, twice daily in the morning before breakfast and two hours after lunch.
5 Pulverize 250 g Mucuna, 100 g Hygrophila, 350 g sugar and mix. The dose is one
teaspoon, twice daily with milk.
6 Pulverize 250 g each of Mucuna, Tribulus and Blepharis edulis and add 400 g sugar.
The dose is as above.
7 Pulverize 250 g each of Mucuna and Phaseolus mungo without their seed coats. Boil
2–3 teaspoons of this powder in 200 ml milk until condensed, cool and take twice
daily.
8 Take 100 g each of Withania, Argyreia, Cyperus scariosus, Mucuna, Tribulus, Asparagus,
Triphala, Mimusops elengi, poppy seed, 50 g of bamboo manna, nutmeg, cardamom
and 500 g sugar. Make a ﬁne powder of all these items. Use one teaspoon twice daily.
9 Pulverize Chlorophytum arundinaceum, Salmalia root, Mucuna, Tribulus, Emblica and
starch from Abrus precatorius. Add the equivalent weight of sugar to that of the
herbal powders. Dose: 15 g with 25 g ghee.
10 Pulverize 300 g Mucuna, 500 g Tribulus, 400 g Piper cubeba, 300 g Hygrophila, 200
g Mesua ferrea, 200 g Chlorophytum, 200 g Salmalia root, 200 g Curculigo orchioides
and 300 g sugar. Dose: 15 g with milk twice daily.
11 Pulverize equal quantities of Mucuna, mace, camphor, Argyreia, Calamus powders
with sugar. Dose: 1 g with milk.

Aphrodisiac for women:
Boil 500 g each of Mucuna and Tribulus in 4 litres of milk until the milk condenses. Add
1 kg sugar and make candy balls of 15 g each. Dry and steep these balls in honey. Use
one ball per day for leucorrhoea, profuse menstruation and other gynaecological problems.

Antidote to Mucuna poisoning
If kawanch preparations show toxic symptoms, then a mixture of ghee, honey and sugar
is a good antidote.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
The consumption of improperly boiled seed increases body temperature and causes
skin eruptions due to L-dopa (L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine). Repeated boiling is known
to reduce the L-dopa content and also that of anti-nutritional factors (Janardhanan and
Lakshmanan, 1985). Mahajani et al. (1996) observed that L-dopa obtained from the
seed or synthetic has the same activity. The major studies on the seed are:

In Parkinsonianism
L-dopa or the standardized seed extract can be used (Rajagopalan et al. 1978).
The patient should start with a daily dose of 250 mg to 1 g of L-dopa, in ﬁve divided
doses. If side effects occur then reduce the dose, otherwise increase it until intolerable.
Improvement may take six months. This treatment controls speech, rigidity and
helps swallowing of food. The therapeutic beneﬁts in this disease cannot be ascribed
to L-dopa alone. The residue of the seed left after the recovery of L-dopa is also
effective.

In anorexia nervosa
Patients with anorexia nervosa improved and gained weight by using the seed.

For haircare
By stimulating hormones, L-dopa helps in the treatment of hyperseborrhoic cases. In
patients with psoriasis, the results were excellent after four months’ treatment. L-dopa
helped in hair growth and development and may turn grey hair black. Hair pigmentation occurred in a white-bearded man after taking L-dopa for 8 months.

Effect on sexual behaviour
By acting on the hypothalamus, L-dopa may arouse sexual interest and cause excessive
sexual behaviour. Sambasiva Rao et al. (1982) put forth the view that L-dopa facilitated sexual behaviour by increasing brain catecholamine. Saksena and Dikshit (1987)
studied the effect of total alkaloids of the seed on spermatogenesis in rats. There was
a noteworthy increase in numbers of spermatozoa, weight of testes, seminal vesicles
and androgenic activity. Ahmad et al. (1991) noted that L-dopa had a stimulant effect
at low doses but a depressant effect at high doses.
According to Elisabetsky et al. (1992) dopaminergic receptors are involved in male
sexual arousal, including the sexual arousal caused by L-dopa. It increased a feeling of
vigour, a sense of well-being and increased interest in oneself, family and surroundings. L-dopa stimulated the release of human growth hormones. In some cases, by

Kawanch 161
administering levodopa, hypergrowth of the penis has also been observed. Sriniviasan
et al. (1994) studied the aphrodisiac activity of the seed on rats. The treatment showed
a signiﬁcant increase in mounting and intermission frequency. Anantha Kumar et al.
(1994) noted that seed powder, 75mg/kg body weight, increased the sexual activity of
male rats considerably. Amin et al. (1993, 1993a, 1996) found that the seed improved
sexual function, general mating behaviour, libido and potency in normal male rats. It
produced a striking and sustained activity in depressed libido and helped in premature
ejaculation. Uguru (1997) studied the effect of aqueous seed extract on the guinea pig
ileum to determine the drug’s mechanism of action. It was found to contain potent
histamine receptor stimulants, which led to an inﬂux of calcium and probably stimulated muscarinic receptors.
Ambekar and Khan (1991) tried a compound preparation of Orchis, Mucuna and
Alpinia for its effect on castrated male rats. The compound increased the weight of
sexual organs signiﬁcantly, indicating an anabolic activity.

Anti-ageing effects
Studies on ageing have shown that in mice given near toxic levels of L-dopa, life
expectancy increased considerably (personal communication).

Analgesic and anti-pyretic effects
Iauk et al. (1993) found that when L-dopa was administered to breast cancer patients,
it reduced prolactin concentration to half, with complete relief of metastatic pain.
Regression occurred on withdrawal of L-dopa.
It cured migraines but, when the drug was withdrawn, migraines reappeared.

As an anti-depressant
Singh et al. (1990) clinically tried this drug on cases of depressive sickness for two
months. There was symptomatic improvement, with a decrease in the degree of anxiety and depression.

For healing fractures
Yang (1985) tried L-dopa as a promoter of fracture healing. A dose of 250–500 mg,
thrice daily, was given orally for treatment of non-union, delayed union and fresh
fractures.

Substitute
The seeds of Mucuna utilis, which are bigger than M. pruriens, are also used for the
same purposes (Ghosh, 1982; Janardhanan and Lakshmanan, 1985).

Chemical studies
Seeds have about 5 per cent oil, 25.3 per cent protein and L-dopa. On boiling, L-dopa
gets reduced but other constituents – glutathione, lecithin, alkaloids, gallic acid,
seratonin – are heat stable.

162 Kawanch

Toxicological studies
It causes nausea, anorexia, vomiting and hypotensive palpitation. Involuntary movements are very common, along with abnormal limb movements. The seeds should be
used with caution in glaucoma, cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary, renal
diseases, and in psychiatric disturbances. Expectant and nursing mothers should not
use any preparations of these seed.

Crocus sativus L.
Family: Iridiaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
English “saffron” is derived from Persian zafran. It is mainly cultivated in Spain,
France, Iran, Turkey and Italy. In India it is only grown in small areas near Srinagar in
Kashmir and in Kishtwar of the Jammu region. Most saffron in India is imported
from Europe, but that from Kashmir is considered the best.
In Kashmir, saffron cultivation starts in the late summer with the transplanting of
the bulbs on the raised beds. The saffron ﬂower (Fig. 21A) is purple in colour and
blooms October–November. Three long styles (Fig. 21B), each with a distinct stigma,
are picked from ﬂowers by hand. Eighteen thousand ﬂowers yield 28 g of saffron. The
stigmas give the ﬁnest quality saffron which in Indian trade is called Shahi Zafran, the
styles give the second grade and the saffron is called Mongra Zafran. The third grade
is Laccha Zafran obtained from the remains of the ﬂowers by cudgelling and winnowing them in water. By this process the petals ﬂoat on the water while the other
essential parts settle. This process is repeated three times to get Laccha Zafran. In the
western countries saffron is also sold in powder form but this is considered inferior.
Saffron is the most expensive of all the spices. Commercial samples are thread-like,
consisting of orange-red strands, trumpet in shape, 1–2 cm long. It is highly aromatic
and bitter in taste. It is adulterated with the style, anther and corolla of saffron ﬂowers,
or with the ﬂoral parts of safﬂower (Carthamus) or marigold (Tagetes or Calendula), or
with vegetable parts coloured with coal tar dyes. The stigma may be soaked in glycerin,
sugar syrup or salt solution to give it a shine and to increase its weight. When a pinch
of a genuine sample is placed on the surface of warm water, the stigma expands immediately and the colour spreads out slowly, whereas with artiﬁcially coloured materials it
diffuses immediately (Madan et al. 1966). When dipped in ethanol, genuine saffron
exudes colour without getting discoloured itself, whereas when using adulterated saffron
the coloured materials are bleached after a while. The characteristic smell of saffron is
produced on drying when picrocin, the bitter constituent, splits, releasing the volatile
safranal.
For use in medicine dried saffron is required. Saffron is dried by placing it on a metallic
plate. A metallic cup is heated and saffron from the plate is covered over with this hot
cup. When the cup gets cold, the saffron is removed and is stored in airtight bottles.

USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda, saffron is considered bitter and anodyne. It vitiates the three doshas
and helps diseases of the head. In the Greco-Arabic system (Unani medicine) saffron is
used for slimming, enlarged livers, urinary, bladder and kidney infections, menstrual
disorders, for strengthening the heart and cooling the brain. With ghee, it is said to
help diabetes.
In traditional Chinese medicine it is used as an anodyne, sedative and emmenagogue
(Sugiura et al., 1995). It is said to make erogenous zones more sensitive and also has a
hormone-like effect, which may be due to carotenoids (crocin and crocetin) contained
in it. Other uses are:

In painful menstruation and for regulating menstrual ﬂow
a A pellet of saffron kept in the uterus helps.
b 250 mg saffron, triturated with half the amount of camphor, is prescribed
three days before menstruation until the bleeding stops. Continue this treatment for six monthly periods.
In dysmenorrhoea, 4–5 pieces of saffron are given daily with goat’s milk.
For pain in the uterus during pregnancy, 4–5 pieces with 20 g butter and
5 g sugar is given. The treatment is repeated every two hours until the pain
subsides.

In paediatrics
For running noses of infants, give milk with one piece of saffron.

As a general tonic
Four to ﬁve stigmas of saffron are wrapped in a leaf of Piper betle. The leaf is then
chewed. This is done every day throughout the winter.

In impotence
The essential oil contained in saffron produces an aphrodisiac effect due to slight
stimulation of the central nervous system. In sexual debility, it is considered a sovereign remedy unsurpassed by the whole range of drugs in materia medica (Trivedi,
1997). It may be used as follows:
1. A mixture of 1 g saffron, 10 g mace and 10 g nutmeg is pulverized. Two grams
of this mixture is taken daily for at least 60 days.
2. Boil 500 ml of milk with four dates, until the milk is reduced to half. Add 5–6
pieces of saffron and sugar to taste. Chew this milk for half an hour before retiring
to bed every evening.

As a nerve tonic
It has an anti-inﬂammatory effect. It is also used for melancholia and neuralgia and
rheumatic pains. For this, make a ﬁne powder of 10 g each of saffron, senna, colchicum
root and sugar. Take 125 mg of this mixture with water, twice daily.

Antidote to poisons
Used for both extraneous and internal toxins (Krishnamurthy, 1993).

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Anti-cancerous activity
Nair et al. (1994) studied the effects of saffron on solid tumour growth in rats. Oral
administration of 100 mg/kg of the saffron extract inhibited Dalton’s lymphoma
ascites (DLA) and S-180 solid tumours by 87 per cent and 41 per cent respectively. A
dose of 150 mg delayed the onset of tumour formation and inhibited its further
growth. Saffron also caused an increase in vitamin A and carotene levels in the serum
of 180 tumour-bearing mice. The activity of saffron was due to crocin, which probablyinduced the anti-tumour effect by its provitamin A activity and/or by antioxidant activity or by modulating the functional levels of the other antioxidants. Escribano
et al. (1996) also observed that crocin, safranal and picrocrocin inhibited the growth
of human cancer cells in vitro. Cells treated with crocin exhibited wide cytoplasmic
vacuole-like areas, reduced cytoplasm, cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei. Saffron
extract inhibited or prevented cancer and its pigments were used to treat papilloma,
hypertension, spinal cord injury, cerebral oedema, arthritis and aﬂatoxin-induced
hepatotoxic lesions (Dufresne et al. 1997). Konoshima et al. (1998) noted that crocin
and crocetin derivatives and 50 per cent ethanol extract of saffron signiﬁcantly inhibited Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation, and mouse skin papilloma.

In heart problems
Due to crocetin, saffron indirectly reduced cholesterol levels in the blood (Baker and
Negbi, 1983). Nishio (1987) noted that it showed a remarkable effect on blood coagulation and platelet aggregation. It accelerated the in vitro ﬁbrinolysis activity of urikinase.

Immunomodulatory effect
Nair et al. (1991) observed that it had a modulatory effect on cisplatin-induced toxicity in mice. The saffron extract prevented the decrease in body weight, haemoglobin

168 Keshar
levels and leucocyte counts caused by 2 mg/kg of cisplatin. Saffron prolonged the lifespan also.

Review
Rios (1996) has reviewed the literature on chemical composition and pharmacological
properties of saffron between 1925–1994. The active constituents have shown antitumour, hypolipidaemic and tissue oxygenation enhancement properties.

Chemical studies
From saffron, 1.37 per cent essential oils, 13.45 per cent ﬁxed oil, crocin (a natural
carotenoid), picrocin and many other compounds have been reported. Genuine saffron has
the colour of crocin, the aroma of safranal and the ﬂavour of picrocrocin. The more
intense the colouring, the better the saffron is.

Toxicological studies
In large doses it can be toxic, narcotic and even lethal, causing violet haemorrhages.
Do not use saffron during pregnancy.

Substitute
In Italy, C. longiﬂorus also yields a saffron-like material. In this case the stigmas have
a high dyeing power but less odour and bitterness (Casoria et al. 1996).

Ayurvedic substitutes
Nagkesar is the commonest substitute, obtained from the stamens of Mesua ferrea,
Ochrocarpus longifolius, or Calophyllum inophyllum. Yellow nagkesar is obtained from buds
or stamens of Michelia champaca.
The Ayurvedic scholars are also of the opinion that nutmeg has a saffron-like
physiological effect and can be used in its place.

Acacia nilotica (L.)Willd. ssp. indica (Benth.) Bre.
Syn: A. arbica Willd.
Family: Leguminosae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The tree is common in arid zones of India. It can easily be identiﬁed by its dark
coloured bark, bipinnate leaves and its spines, about 2 cm long at the base of the
leaves (Fig. 22A). The inﬂorescence is yellow, globular and up to 2 cm in diameter.
Pods are 15 cm long with 8–12 seeds. The tree yields a translucent gum, yellow to
brown in colour, known as gum arabica, which resembles gum acacia obtained from
A. senegal Willd. (Fig. 22B) in its physical properties.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Gum arabica is a well known household item in the northwest part of India and is
considered quite nutritive. It is mainly used after frying in ghee. The unripe pods are
also well esteemed. They may be used as dry powder or in the form of a thick
translucent sheet of dry juice extracted from the fresh pods.
As per Ayurveda, all parts of the tree provide energy to the body. Kikar is dry,
heavy, astringent, cooling and helps in kapha and pitta. Gum is diuretic, astringent and helps ulcers of the buccal cavity, dry coughs, dryness and inﬂammation
of the throat. Tender pods are astringent, used in various sexual deﬁciencies.
They are anti-leprotic, anthelmintic, blood puriﬁers, healers of wound and vasoconstrictors. (All these properties may be due to tannins, which have an astringent
effect.) The uses of the tree, some of which are as per Saxena Parvar (1998), are as
follows:

As a general tonic
Fry the gum in ghee and dip it in the sugar syrup. Two to three teaspoons of this
mixture, when taken daily, makes the body strong and healthy. It is also good for
mental powers and virility. In another recipe, the legume Phaseolus mungo is soaked in
water over night to remove the seed coat. The resulting seed kernel is ground to form
a thick paste, which is then fried in ghee. When the paste turns brown, sugar syrup is

Kikar 171

added and the whole mass is stirred until thick in consistency. To this mass, gum
arabica and dry fruits are added as per taste and availability, and when hot, the whole
mass is made into candy balls of 50–250 g each. The dose is as per the digestive
power of the individual.

For bronchial troubles
The gum soothes the throat through its mucilaginous action, and coagulates any blood
in the sputum.

172 Kikar

For urinogenital diseases

Slightly heat 25 g each of gum arabica, gum tragacanth, gum kino (Butea frondosa),
gum mastagi roomi (Pistacia lentiscus) and make a ﬁne powder. One teaspoon of this
powder with cold water may be taken twice daily for nocturnal emission.
When equal parts of dry leaves, bark, ﬂowers and the gum of this tree are powdered
and administered, it increases the viscosity of spermatic ﬂuid and helps in other
urinogenital diseases.
For venereal diseases, if pus and blood are passed through the urethra, make
decoction of gum and tender leaves of acacia, sugar and black pepper. Drink 10 ml
of this decoction, and douche the urethra with this solution.
For syphilis, steep 35 g of young tree buds in water for the night. In the morning
macerate these buds by hand to form a thick infusion. Drink this infusion with 25
g of warm ghee. Repeat this treatment for 2–3 days or more, but for a week after
that do not add ghee and drink the infusion only.
For urinary troubles, in summer, particularly in arid zones, the urine may
become scanty because of lack of water in the body and may cause burning
sensation during urination. In this situation gum arabica mucilage is prescribed
for drinking, and the patient is advised to eat three to four dry acacia pods every
day.
For scanty urine in the summer, 5 g of a ﬁne powder made from equal quantities
of dry, tender kikar and Tribulus fruit leaves is prescribed twice daily with milk.
An infusion of tender pods may also be used.

For gynaecological problems

One dessertspoonful of ﬁnely powdered gum is fried in an equal quantity of
ghee, and a cup of water and sugar are added as per taste, followed by a pinch of
cardamom seed. This mixture is taken on an empty stomach in the morning. It is
a tasty, nutritious preparation and, if consumed after menstruation, brings about
contraction of uterus, vagina, and prevents leucorrhoea.
In leucorrhoea, a decoction of the bark with or with out alum is used for
douching.
Two grams of equal quantities of powdered dry pod, gum and bark cures leucorrhoea
and backache when given three times a day with milk or water.
A small piece of dry juice from the pods, if inserted in the vagina, acts as an antiinﬂammatory agent. It also removes sluggishness of the muscles and brings about
vaginal contractions.
Gum arabica fried in ghee, provides energy to both embryo and the mother when
administered to an expectant mother.
A mixture of 3 g gum arabica with 3 g wheat ﬂour helps excessive bleeding
during menstruation.

For anal and vaginal prolapse
Boil acacia bark in water until reduced to one-fourth. Soak muslin in this decoction
and insert it in the required place. The remaining decoction may be used for enema
and douching.

Kikar 173

For diarrhoea and dysentery
Soak small quantity of leaves and gum of Acacia tree in water and ﬁlter them after
maceration. Prescribe two teaspoon of this ﬁltrate every two hours. Gum alone may
also be used. It provides nutrition to stomach and alimentary canal. The powder of
tender leaves also helps gastroenteritis.

As an anabolic agent
Take 200 g almond kernel, 50 g gum arabica and 250 g raw sugar. Soak almond
in water overnight, remove the seed coat in the morning, dry the kernel and make
a ﬁne powder. Fry gum arabica in a minimum quantity of ghee and make a ﬁne
powder. Mix the powders of almond, gum and sugar to the fried gum. Take 10 g
of this mixture for 2–3 months with milk, twice daily, before breakfast and after
dinner.

For eczema
Boil 25 g each of acacia and mango bark in 1 litre of water and foment the affected
part with water vapours, followed by an application of ghee.

As a rejuvenator
Five grams of dry juice, when given with milk, helps the sexual power of weak, old
and convalescent patients.

Ayurvedic preparations
Veerya shodhan churn
Method Pulverize equal quantities of tender pods, tender leaves and gum arabica and
mix them in an equal quantity of sugar.

shilajit (a herbomineral compound of natural origin), 10 g black pepper, 10 g cinnamon,
10 g Cinnamomum spp. leaves, 10 g Mesua ferrea ﬂowers, 10 g cardamom seed, 10 g
each of processed coral, iron, mica and tin, 5 g saffron, 250 g ghee, 2 kg sugar and dry
fruits as per taste. Make a ﬁne powder of gum and fry it in ghee. Pulverize all other
herbs and spices but leave the saffron and minerals to be powdered separately.

174 Kikar
Chop the dry fruits, almond, pistachio, dry dates, dry grapes and coconut, etc. Make
a very ﬁne powder of saffron and minerals and pass them through a sieve or muslin of
mesh size 200. Make a syrup of sugar. To this syrup, when hot, add all the powdered
herbs and spices, followed by saffron and minerals, and then dry fruits. Make candy
balls of 25 g each from this mixture.
Dose In winter take 25–50 g as per the digestive power of the person. It should be
chewed along with warm milk in the morning, when the stomach is empty.
Use A highly nutritious preparation, for the proper sexual life of both males and
females. It is of immense use after childbirth; it imparts beauty and health both to the
mother and the infant.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Both the bark and pod contain tannin and gallic acid, which help in the removal of
catarrhal matter from the bronchi, arrest bleeding, sooth the inﬂamed pharynx, alimentary canal and urinogenital organs. Gum is useful in glycaemia and cholesterolaemia.
The bark has a hypoglycaemic property. It signiﬁcantly reduced the blood glucose
concentration, by peripheral utilization of glucose (Singhal, 1984).

Toxicological studies
Gum acacia from A. senegal was found quite safe as a food item (Anderson, 1986).

Strychnos nux vomica L.
Family: Loganiaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The tree grows wild in tropical and semi-evergreen forests of central India.
It is a deciduous tree with short spines and thin, grey, smooth bark. Leaves are
7.5–15 cm long, 5–7.5 cm broad, elliptic (Fig. 23A), with numerous greenish
white ﬂowers. The fruit is globose, 2.5–7.5 cm and orange when ripe. The seed is
(Fig. 23B) discoid concave on one side, convex on the other, up to 2.5 cm in diameter
and covered with brown grey, silky hair, radiating from the centre. The seed is leathery
and very difﬁcult to powder.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA

Mitigation of seed
The seed is very bitter and highly poisonous but some people get addicted to it and
tolerate the lethal dose. For use in Ayurvedic preparations, it is partially detoxiﬁed by
any of the following methods:
1
2
3
4
5
6

By boiling in equal quantities of milk and water, removing emerging cotyledons
(said to be poisonous) when soft. The hot soft kernel turns hard on cooling, so
these seed are boiled again until soft enough to pulverize.
Cow’s urine is used in place of water and the seed is allowed to remain in it for a
number of days until soft enough for crushing.
The seed is put in clean clay soil and allowed to remain in it until soft.
The easiest method for powdering the seed is to heat it in ghee in an iron pan over
a mild heat until the outer skin of the seed turns red brown. Remove the outer
skin and powder the kernel.
The seed is turned into dust-like powder using iron ﬁles.
In south India (Shanvaskhan, 1997) seed are boiled with rice and water for three
hours. When they are cooked, after removal of seed coat, they are chopped into

176 Kuchla

small pieces and immersed in the juice of Chenopodium ambrosiodes for 3 hours and
ﬁnally boiled in a decoction of Semecarpus anacardium seed.
These mitigation treatments deplete the alkaloid concentration (Agrawal and Joshi,
1977), without changing their composition (Bhanu and Vasudevan, 1977).
A dose of 30–60 mg of mitigated nux vomica is commonly given, sometimes it may
be increased to 125 mg, but it may stimulate the heart at this dose and may be lethal.
The major uses of processed nux vomica are:

As an antidote to poisons
It is an antidote to lead poison, rabid dog bites, snakebites and opium overdose.

For wasting diseases
For wasting diseases in infants and children, mitigated nux vomica is given along with
powder of dry liver and kuchla oil.

Kuchla

177

As a general stimulant
In Ayurveda, it is considered hot in effect and a stimulant for intellectuals and students,
etc. It stimulates the respiratory system, neuromuscular system and makes the heart
strong. It also helps lethargy of generative organs.

For the digestive system
For indigestion due to physiological weakness and for constipation, it is a drug of
choice. It is used in obesity, as it burns fat from the liver. Nux vomica helps cases of
acute gastric disturbance, when the patient’s stools are watery, the patient has acute
thirst, the stool is blood coloured (as in piles) or if the urge to pass stools and urine
persists but regular movement is not there. It strengthens the stomach and digestive
system by contractions of the alimentary canal.

For gynaecological problems
It relieves backache, delayed menstruation, dysmenorrhoea and leucorrhoea, when
accompanied by yellow, foetid vaginal discharge.

Contraindications
It should be given in the minimum dose to people who live in solitude and get angry
easily, and also to patients who have hyperacidity, acute ﬂatulence, urinary incontinence, inﬂammation of the urethra, burning urination and nasal haemorrhages.

Toxicity
In the case of toxic symptoms, a leaf paste of Abrus precatorius along with gruel of
arrow root (Maranta arundinacea) powder is given.

Ayurvedic preparations
Kuchla oil
Method Heat 15 g nux vomica seed in 100 ml of sesame oil until seed turns brown,
ﬁlter and use the oil.
Use For external application in paralysis and wasting diseases of children. For
migraines, make a paste of this oil with equal quantities of cinnamon, or Piper longum
root, add cow’s urine and apply.
Navjovan rasa
Method Macerate 25 g processed nux vomica, 25 g processed iron, 5 g each of ras
sindur (red sulphide of mercury), black pepper, long pepper and ginger in ginger juice
and make pills of 60 mg each.

178 Kuchla
Use It is said to rejuvenate the body. It increases gastric juices so food is digested
properly and provides strength to the body, nervous system, and stomach. It helps gastric
problems, memory, chronic constipation, migraines or pain in any part of the body.
Laxmivillas ras
Method Take 75 g processed nux vomica, 75 g borax, 75 g black pepper, 50 g
processed iron, 25 g puriﬁed sulphur and 12 g puriﬁed mercury. Triturate mercury
and sulphur, add the powders of all other ingredients along with juice of ginger,
followed by the juices of Asparagus, Phyllanthus niruri and Eclipta to saturate the
mixture. Dry, repeat this process three times and make pills of 60 mg each.
Use As a rejuvenator it helps convalescence, wasting diseases, loss of vitality and
spermatic liquid. It is a spermatogenic, makes skin look young and healthy and cures
indigestion.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Strychnine stimulates respiratory and vasomotor centres. It has selective action on the
central nervous system (CNS), more particularly on bone marrow. Small doses produce
vasodilation. By its action on the cerebral cortex and peripheral nerves, it exhibits
marked hyperactivity. It remains in the alimentary tract for a long time and exerts its
inﬂuence on digestive system by gradual absorption.
Furukawa et al. (1985) observed that strychnine has direct depressant effect on the
heart and inhibits the release of acetylcholine.
Panda and Panda (1993) tested its anti-gastric and anti-ulcer activity and found its
effect equivalent to that of cimetidine.

Chemical studies
The seed has 1.8 to 2 per cent of total alkaloids, 42 per cent fatty oil and α-amyrin.
The seed ratio of strychnine to brucine varies from 2 : 1 to 1 : 1. It is said that during
germination or during treatments with aqueous ﬂuids (mitigation), strychnine disappears whilst brucine, which occurs in the outer cells of the endosperm, is gradually
converted into strychnine.

Toxicological studies
Large doses of nux vomica cause tetanic convulsions and eventually death results. Even
with safe doses there may be some mental derangement.

Alpinia galanga Willd.
Family: Scitamineae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a herb (Fig. 24A) growing in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of south and
east India. The rhizome (Fig. 24B), sometimes imported from the Java islands of
Indonesia, is reddish brown, cylindrical, about 3 cm in diameter and 4–8 cm long,
with raised rings and scars on the leaf bases. Its fracture is hard, taste pungent and
odour spicy. In India, it is known as kulanjan or khuljanjan or as a source of a controversial herb rasna. In Europe it is known as greater galanga. A closely allied species
A. ofﬁcinarum Hance, imported from southeast China, is called lesser galangal (Wren,
1975) or galangol (Ratsch, 1997).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The Arabian physician Ibn Al-Baytar attributed a love promoting property to the
root. It has been used as an aphrodisiac and as an additive to stimulating liquors since
the 8th century. In German folk medicine it is also considered a tonic for sexual
activities (Ratsch, 1997).
It is an aromatic, stimulant, carminative and expectorant. It is mainly used for
bronchial troubles, where small pieces may be chewed, under the name Pan ki Jar. (It
means root of pan, Piper betle is a wrong identiﬁcation, galangal root has no relation
with P. betle.) Sometimes it is prescribed for impotence and nervous debility, probably
because of its vasodilator effect. In Ayurveda it is used in the treatment of various
inﬂammatory diseases, diabetes mellitus and obesity (Achuthan and Padikkala, 1995).
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Anti-microbial property
Janssen and Scheiffer (1985) showed that an essential oil from A. galanga has activity
against gram positive bacteria, yeast and some dermatophytes.

Kulanjan 181

Figure 24 Alpinia galanga A twig, B root (diagrammatic).

Anti-tumour activity
Itokawa et al. (1987) isolated anti-tumour principles from it against Sarcoma 180
ascites in mice. Zheng et al. (1993) found two potential anticarcinogens in essential
oils. These two isolated compounds exhibited carcinogen detoxiﬁcation. A new potential
chemopreventive agent was also detected.

Anti-ulcer activity
Al-Yahya (1990) observed gastric, anti-secretory, anti-ulcer and cytoprotective properties in the ethanol extract of the root. The extract signiﬁcantly reduced the intensity of
gastric mucosal damage and decreased gastric secretion. It had cytoprotective effect
against sodium chloride-induced damage.

182 Kulanjan

Anabolic effects
Weight gain in A. galanga treated animals was signiﬁcantly higher compared with the
control. Haematological studies revealed a signiﬁcant rise in red blood cells and a
signiﬁcant drop in white blood cells. A signiﬁcant gain in the weight of sexual organs
and an increase in sperm motility and sperm count were observed (Quershi et al.
1992). Two groups of compounds, identiﬁed as gingerols and diarylhepatanoids, were
effective against prostaglandin biosynthesizing enzymes (Kiuchi et al. 1992).

Anti-hepatotoxic effect
The ethanol extract of this root reversed the cytological and biochemical changes
induced by cyclophosphamide in mice liver (Quershi et al. 1994). Jung et al. (1996)
isolated a compound galangin from it, which was effective in induced hepatotoxicity.

In atherosclerosis
Achuthan and Padikkala (1995) studied the ethanol extract for hypolipidaemic activity
and following the studies concluded that it might be useful in various lipid disorders
especially atherosclerosis.

Chemical studies
The root contains an essential oil, which has 48 per cent methyl cinnamate, 20–30 per
cent cineole, camphor and probably d-pinene (Nadkarni, 1976). A ﬂavonoid glangin
has also been reported (Jung et al. 1996).

Toxicological studies
Quershi et al. (1992) did not ﬁnd any spermatotoxic effects in the root.

Substitutes
Kaempferia galangal is known as galangal in Europe. It may be Kapur kachri of India
(Hedychium spicatum is also known by this name). It is an important ingredient of
Indonesian jamu preparations. These preparations have aphrodisiac, stimulating and
psychedelic properties (Ratsch, 1997).

Picrorhiza kurrooa
Syn. P. kurrooa Royle ex Benth.
P. scrophulariaeﬂora
Family: Scrophulariaceae
In Indian literature, the name of this herb is commonly given as Picrorhiza kurroa
Royle ex Benth. so in the present book this name has been used in place of the valid
one, given above.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
P. kurrooa grows in the alpine Himalayas of North India, and P. scrophulariaeﬂora in
the Eastern Himalayas and Tibet, at an altitude of 3,000–5,000 m. However these
species are getting increasingly scarce by the day. The local name of the herb in north
India is kaur, which means bitter. It is a small hairy herb, with rope-like rootstock, up
to 0.5 cm thick, covered with the basis of withered leaves (Fig. 25A,B). Leaves are 5–
10 cm long with a rounded tip and may be arranged in a rosette form. The ﬂowering
spike, with many ﬂowers, is longer than the leaves.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda, kutaki is considered a nutritive in the sense that it increases the appetite
by stimulating gastric secretion. Because of its non-nauseating smell and taste, it is
an ingredient of many preparations used as liver tonics and appetizers. It is not an
astringent so it does not cause constipation. It helps in dyspepsia. It is a laxative in
small doses, but cathartic in larger ones. It is commonly prescribed against fevers ( pitta
jawar virodhi), particularly for those patients who have a high temperature, burning
sensation all over the body including the eyes, dry mouths with a frequent urge for
water, and red eruptions on the skin.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Both the whole root and Picroliv, as an isolated standardized preparation, containing
two iridoid glycosides (picroside I and kutkoside) have been studied.

Antihepatotoxic activity
Some of the earlier studies on this herb indicated hepatoprotective and chloretic activity against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic damage. Later studies demonstrated

186 Kutaki
that the various constituents of the root powder, its alcoholic extract, kutkin, picroside I and kutkoside had anti-inﬂammatory activity. Dass et al. (1976) conﬁrmed
that the bitter glucosides and its constituent, organic acids, cinnamic acid and vanillic
acid have a signiﬁcant chloretic and laxative effect. Hepatoprotective, chloretic and
immunostimulant activity was seen in the alcoholic extract of the herb by Ansari et al.
(1988). It stimulated both cell-mediated and humoral activity. Active principle kutkin
showed signiﬁcant activity in hepatic damage induced by galactosamine in rats and by
Plasmodium berghei in Mastomys. Singh et al. (1982) observed anti-viral activity in the
root against live vaccine virus, by the oral administration of P. kurrooa before and after
the rise in temperature. It induced non-speciﬁc resistance in animals and thus was
effective in viral hepatitis.
Picroliv provided signiﬁcant protection to liver against carbon tetrachloride. The
degree of protection was similar before and after the treatment (Dwivedi et al. 1990).
Shukla et al. (1991) evaluated it for chloretic and anti-cholestatic activity. It showed
a potent effect with signiﬁcant reversal of enzymatic parameters. It also reversed
thioacetamide-induced cholestasis. A signiﬁcant reversal of these effects was achieved
by treatment in a dose-dependent manner. It was more active than a known hepatoprotective compound, silymarin (Shukla et al. 1992). Picroliv provided protection
against hepatitis B virus. It had oxygen-free radical scavenging property comparable
with that of α-tocopherol. Rastogi et al. (1991) reported that it reversed enzymatic
changes in liver toxicated with D-galactosomine or thioactamide. When studied for its
effect on mice chromosomes in bone marrow cells, it was devoid of clastigenic activity
(Jain and Sethi, 1992). Visen et al. (1994) studied the effect of Picroliv in combination with other bitters and hepatoprotectants, suh as andrographolide, obtained from
Andrographis paniculata. One of these combinations showed hepatoprotection in 90–
95 per cent of cases. Chander et al. (1994) administered Picroliv orally to Mastomys
natalensis infected with Plasmodium berghei. It provided signiﬁcant protection to
M. natalensis by helping against the depletion of glutathione levels in the liver and
brain. Srivastava et al. (1996) reported the effect of Picroliv on liver regeneration by
administering 6 mg/kg of it to rats before hepatectomy. It enhanced liver DNA,
RNA, protein and cholesterol levels compared with hepatectomized untreated rats.
In patients with mycobacterial infection, where rifampicin was used and Picroliv
administered along with it, the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic were not modiﬁed
but patients were protected against liver damage (Dwivedi et al. 1996). It also protected against alcohol-induced chronic hepatotoxicity.

Immunostimulant activity
Picrorhiza kurroa is a potent immunostimulant, inducing both cell mediated and humoral
immunity, speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc (Singh et al. 1982). This characteristic is believed
to impart positive health and it maintains organic resistance against infection by reestablishing body equilibrium and conditioning body tissues. It had a restorative,
rejuvenator, protective effect and saved organisms from extraneous substances, maintaining homeostasis. Simons et al. (1989, 1990) found that this immunomodulating
effect was due to two anti-complementary polymeric fractions from the aqueous extract
of the root. These were dose dependent. Puri et al. (1992) studied the immunostimulant
activity of Picroliv, it enhanced the non-speciﬁc immunoresponse characterized by an
increase in macrophage migration index.

Kutaki

187

In vitiligo
Bedi et al. (1989) observed that the herb potentiated photochemotherapy in vitiligo.

Anti-cancerous property
The effect of P. kurrooa on the functions of macrophages obtained from mice treated
with carcinogen ochratoxin A was investigated by Dhuley (1997). The chemotactic
activity of murine macrophages was signiﬁcantly decreased.

Anti-microbial property
The aqueous alcoholic extract displayed inhibitory action on virulent strains of Salmonella typhi septicemia. When a traditional polyherbal preparation containing P. kurrooa
and the only roots of. P. kurrooa were studied, both had an inhibitory effect on S. typhi.
It protected in cases of both pre- and post-infection, in single and multiple dose
schedules (Sohni et al. 1995).

Hypolipidaemic activity
Khanna et al. (1994) found Picroliv was a hypolipidaemic agent, which acted through
lowering protein and lipid levels by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis in liver, by
bile acid excretion and by enhanced plasma lecithin.

Anti-ulcer activity
Biswas et al. (1992) found a kutaki effective in duodenitis, a pre-ulcerogenic condition,
in duodenal ulcer. Singh et al. (1993) reported anti-inﬂammatory activity in its fractions.
There was no effect on the spleen, thymus, adrenal gland or evidence of gastric
mucosal damage through the use of this herb. Bandyopadhyay and Bandyopadhyay
(1995) observed that it showed anti-ulcer activity by protecting gastric mucosa. It had
a cytoprotective effect and it lowered gastric volume.

Antioxidant activity
Chander et al. (1991) observed antioxidant activity in Picroliv. Rastogi (1995) studied
this activity in liver after partial hepatectomy.

Adulterants and substitutes
The common admixture is Gentiana kurroo (Family: Gentianaceae), but adulteration
with Helleborus niger, called khurasani kutaki (Khurasan is a town in central Asia) has
been recorded earlier. The root of khurasani kutaki is bigger, toxic and a high dose of
it may induce purging and vomiting, leading to death.

190 Kuth

34 Kuth

Saussurea costus (Falc.) Lipsch.
Syn. S. lappa (Decne) Sch.-Bip
(Sometimes an old name Aplotaxis auriculata is used)
Family: Compositae (Asteraceae)
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is cultivated in the alpine zone of the western Himalayas (Lahaul and Spiti, and
along the Indo-Tibetan border). Earlier it was collected from these areas and cultivated
in some parts of alpine Kashmir. In the last century, it was a precious commodity in
the Indo-Chinese trade and was one of the few medicinal plants which were cultivated
in Kashmir. Chinese merchants at that time would pay the equivalent weight of the
roots in silver, so at that time the kuth plantations in Khilanmarg (Kashmir) were
guarded day and night by security men to ensure the roots were not stolen. Recently
the trend has changed. This herb is now being cultivated on a large scale in China and
is being smuggled from China into India through the eastern Himalayas. In Chinese
medicine it is used under the name Saussureae Radix.
The plant (Fig. 26A) may grow up to 2 m in length. The radical leaves have a long
stalk. The ﬂower head is sessile, hard, round and 3–5 cm in diameter, with dark
purple to black ﬂowers. The seeds are achene, about 3 mm long, curved and compressed. The aromatic root (Fig. 26B) is horn-like, rough from outside, up to 10 cm
thick and may be 20 cm or more long, but in trade broken pieces are often available.
When cut, the root depicts a dark brown cylindrical centre.
The Sanskrit name of the root is kushta, but the trade name kuth or bitter kuth,
is well known in the Indian subcontinent. Sometimes, because of the root’s close
resemblance with Inula racemosa, it is identiﬁed as pushkarmul, with which it is often
confused. A number of aromatic, tuberous, tapering roots obtained from various
species of Inula, Costus, Iris or of wild Withania are known as meetha kuth (meetha means
sweet) to differentiate them from the genuine herb, which is called bitter kuth.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As per Ayurveda it is hot, aromatic, carminative, stimulant, diuretic and alterative.
The major uses of the root are:

Kuth 191

Figure 26 Saussurea lappa A twig, B root.

As a tonic
It has a good effect on the central nervous system. As a Rasayana ﬁne powder of the
herb with ghee and honey is licked twice daily. It keeps all infections away and imparts
longevity.

For bronchial problems
In asthma, ﬁne powder of the root, 3–4 times a day, is a prophylactic before an attack.
It does not have side effects like those of adrenaline or of anti-asthmatic cigarettes.
After prescribing for 10–15 days, the medication should be stopped to see the effects. If
required, the treatment may be repeated again. It has not got a cumulative or intolerance
effect. When smoked in small quantities, it reduces the swelling and clears a sore throat.

192 Kuth

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
In arthritis, powder of kuth with castor oil is administered internally and applied
externally. As an anti-inﬂammatory agent, it gives relief from headache and other
body aches and pains. For external purposes, it is mixed with rose water and applied.

As a hair darkner
In China, hair is fumigated with the smoke from the root for darkening grey hair.

For healing ulcers
In skin diseases, root powder mixed in ointment is applied on ulcers.
THERAPEUTICAL INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Anti-microbial properties
Essential oils are strongly antiseptic and disinfectant, especially against Streptococcus
and Staphylococcus bacteria (Nadkarni, 1954). Chen et al. (1995) examined the anti-viral
activities of the crude extract. Two active constituents, costunolide and dehydrocostus
lactone, showed a strong suppressive effect on the component of the hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) in human hepatoma Hep3B cells.

Anti-inﬂammatory activity
It suppressed chemokines, which are involved in the migration of leucocytes from
circulation to accumulated inﬂamed sites, and thus has an important role in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis ( Jung et al. 1998).

As a cardio-stimulant
It relaxed involuntary muscles and acted as a cardiostimulant (Nadkarni, 1954). Dwivedi
et al. (1987, 1989) observed the root’s prostaglandin E2-like activity in the ischaemic
aorta. The crude powder reduced the frequency of angina.

As a bronchodilator
An alkaloid saussurine obtained from the root had a depressant effect on the vagus
nerves in the medulla, on bronchioles and on involuntary muscles, which relaxed the
respiratory tubules (Nadkarni, 1954).

Anti-tumour effect
The root resolved tumours (Nadkarni, 1954). Lee et al. (1995) observed that various
fractions of the root had inhibitory effects on IL-8 induction in lipopolysaccharide

Kuth 193
activated rat macrophages. Taniguchi et al. (1995) isolated costunolide and dehydrocostus
lactone from the root, which acted as inhibitors of the killing function of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes. Cho et al. (1998) reported that the total methanolic extract (sesquiterpenes)
showed a potent inhibitory effect on the production of tumours.

Hypoglycaemic effect
Singh and Sharma (1990) reported anti-diabetic (diabetes mellitus) activity in the
root. Chaturvedi et al. (1993) studied the effect of alcoholic extract of the root on
glucose metabolism. It showed a signiﬁcant hypoglycaemic response by stimulating
the thyroid. Chaturvedi et al. (1995) compared this hypoglycaemic activity of the root
with that of Inula racemosa. Kuth extract increased concentrations of liver glycogen but
reduced that of plasma insulin (Upadhyay et al. 1996).
Inulin contained in the root may be playing a part in anti-diabetic activity. Inulin
helps to stabilize blood glucose levels as it has a zero glycaemic index.

Aphrodisiac activity
Chopra et al. (1958) postulated that the essential oils contained in the root, when
excreted, produce a certain amount of irritation in the urethra, giving rise to penile
erection. Other studies showed that this activity might be due to alkaloid saussurine,
which has an adrenalin-like effect.

Anti-ulcer effect
Yamahara et al. (1985, 1990) observed that costunolide from acetone extract had
cholagogic, anti-ulcer and a gastrointestinal motility enhancing effect. Yoshikawa
et al. (1993) isolated an anti-ulcer principle, saussureamine A, which exhibited inhibitory activity on stress-induced ulcer formation.
A herbal preparation containing S. lappa had a protective effect on gastric and
duodenal ulcers induced by chemical and physical agents (Mitra et al. 1996).

Neuroleptic effect
A compound isolated from the benzene fraction had an effect similar to that of
chlorpromazine (Okugawa et al. 1996).

In gynaecological practice
Saussurea polysaccaharides had a stimulating effect on isolated rat uterus, which was
dose dependent (Lin and Wang, 1986).

In digestive problems
Inulin present in the root is a non-digestible food ingredient, an appetite suppressant.
It increases the faecal matter and improves the bacterial ecology in the colon. It
stimulates the growth and activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon
(such as biﬁdobacteria) and cleanses the intestine by reducing the amount of harmful

194 Kuth
intestinal bacteria. It increases the biﬁdobacterial count 5–8 times and brings a signiﬁcant reduction in Bacteriosides fusobacteria and Clostridia (Kleessen et al. 1997, Gibson
et al. 1995, Bouhnik et al. 1996).

Chemical studies
The root contains 2–5 per cent essential oils, 0.5 per cent alkaloid saussurine, 18 per
cent inulin, 6 per cent resin, potassium nitrate and valeric acid.

Toxicology
When smoked, it has an opium-like narcotic effect, but no toxic effect has been observed in alcohol extract (Chaturvedi et al. 1993).

Adulterants and substitutes
The root is sometimes substituted by Echinops latifolia in Russia (Batorova et al. 1980).

Celastrus paniculatus Willd.
Family: Celastraceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It grows as a deciduous climber in the warm hilly areas of Himalayas up to 1,000
metres, in hotter parts of south and east India, and the middle and south of Andamans
islands. The plant has white spots on young twigs. Leaves are 5–12 cm long in various
rounded shapes (Fig. 27A). The ﬂowers are greenish yellow and about 1 cm in diameter. The seed are black (Fig. 27B), pepper-like but with a yellow to red cover. On
pressing between the ﬁngers, the seed coat gets separated from the kernel and on
further pressing changes into an oily mass.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda, the seed is considered hot, dry and is either applied externally or administered internally, in the following forms:
1
2
3
4
5

When the seed alone is prescribed, the initial dose is one seed for the ﬁrst day,
increased by one seed each day until a maximum dose of ﬁfty seeds is achieved.
Seeds are boiled in milk and used.
An oil is prepared by heating the seed in an inverted bottle. The pure oil which is
obtained is pungent, scarlet or yellow in colour. Dose: 10–20 drops.
Krishna tailam or Black oil is prepared from a mixture of malakangni seed, benzoin,
clove, nutmeg and mace. Dose: 10–30 drops
Triturate a mixture of 40 g each of Celastrus oil, honey and ghee for a few hours.
The mixture is stored in a sealed container and is allowed to ferment for six
months in a warm place. When ready, a dose of 125 mg is prescribed, three times
daily for three months, as a brain tonic in winter.

The above preparations are used as nervine tonic in gout, paralysis, rheumatism,
leprosy, in mental illness, to promote memory, to stimulate intellect and as an aphrodisiac. The oil has a powerful stimulant action in paralysis. In the Siddha system of
medicine, the oil is given to build stamina. During the administration of this seed in
any form, a strict diet of just milk, roasted meat and bread is given.

Malakangani 197

Figure 27 Celastrus paniculatus A twig, B seed.

In the Philippines, it is prescribed as an antidote to opium poisoning. It is also being
used to reverse brain damage caused by organophosphate pesticides and similar toxins.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As a tranquillizer
The oil acted as a tranquillizer in low doses. At a dose of 50–100mg/kg, the oil
produced a gradual fall in cardiac output, bradycardia and a marked increase in pulse
pressure in isolated heart and lung preparations (Gaitonde et al. 1957, Seth et al.

198 Malakangani
1963). It was found to be a central nervous system active agent (Dandiya and Chopra,
1970, Singh et al. 1974, Ahumada et al. 1991). Further tests suggested that it had
tranquillizing, anti-convulsant, muscle relaxant property, and anti-pyretic, analgesic
and anti-ulcerogenic effects, which shows it is a good adaptogen. It was effective in
psychiatric cases of depression and hysteria (Balaraman, 1971).
An Ayurvedic drug containing this oil, when tested by Kakrani et al. (1985), reduced depletion of liver glycogen, inhibited glycogenolysis in the muscle ﬁbres of rats,
indicating the protective effect in stress. There was a signiﬁcant increase of the narcosis time in both male and female mice. Another Ayurvedic preparation containing
malkangani was effective in residual schizophrenia (Tripathi and Singh 1994).

For enhancing memory
It hastened the learning process in rats, which was statistically signiﬁcant and the
results were comparable to that of vasopressin, a known agent for the learning process
(Karnath et al. 1980, 1994). Through its use the three monoamines, norepinephrine,
dopamine and serotonine and their metabolites, which are involved in the memory
and learning process, decreased signiﬁcantly in the brain. Nalini et al. (1995) found
signiﬁcant memory retention in rats treated with this drug.

In hemiplegia
Namboodiri et al. (1991) found an oil containing Celastrus to be effective in hemiplegia.

Hypolipidaemic effect
The 50 per cent alcohol extract of the seed showed hypolipidaemic and anti-arterosclerotic
effects in rats. It reduced both serum cholesterol and LDL and prevented atherogenesis.
It prevented the accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides in liver and aorta,
regressed atheromatous plaques of ascending thoracic and abdominal aorta. Faecal
secretion of cholesterol was signiﬁcantly increased, suggesting that the modulation of
absorption was affected (Mathur et al. 1993).

Chemical studies
Two alkaloids, celastrine and paniculatine are reported.

Toxicological studies
At low doses, it is clinically safe, with low toxicity. Large doses cause burning of the
skin. An oil fraction produced a transient fall in fatty degeneration in the liver and
transient tubular damage in the kidney, but it was not found harmful in the long run.
(Bidwai et al. 1990).

200 Mandukparni (Gotu Kola)

36 Mandukparni (Gotu Kola)

Centella asiatica (L.) Urban
Syn. Hydrocotyle asiatica L.
Family: Umbelliferae
The herb is known as brahmi in the Indian subcontinent and gotu kola in the western world.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is cosmopolitan in its natural distribution and grows along damp shady streams, in
ponds, particularly on the marshy land, along the river banks and in irrigated ﬁelds up
to 2,000 m high ((Bagchi and Puri, 1988) in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Madagascar and South Africa. It is cultivated in east India, Kenya and Hawaii. The plant
is a herb, a ground creeper (Fig. 28A) having orbicular-reniform, crenate leaves, up to
7 cm in diameter (Fig. 28B), which can be easily identiﬁed by epidermal peel in its
dry form (Fig. 28C, D); 3–6 ﬂowers are arranged in an umbel. The seeds are compressed.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Mandukparni is considered cool, bitter, a brain tonic and a Rasayana. The major uses of
this herb are:

As a Rasayana
An old proverb says that Two leaves a day will keep old age away.
In Rasayana chikitsa (rejuvenation treatment) the juice of the herb or a polyherbal
preparation called Brahmi ghrit is prescribed for kayakalp (complete overhaul of body
systems). It may be used during daily routines but kuti praveshika (conﬁnement to an
isolated hut for treatment) is said to give better results.

As a brain tonic
It is one of three major Medhya Rasayana (tonics for brain) herbs and is said to sharpen
memory. In an earlier ethnobotanical study by a European, who lived in India in the
nineteenth century, it was mentioned that consuming a few leaves of Centella strengthened
and revitalized the mind to a remarkable degree, providing the body is exposed to sun.

Mandukparni (Gotu Kola) 201

Figure 28 Centella asiatica A herb, B a leaf, C, D epidermal peel (diagrammatic).

It prevented brain fog and nervous breakdown. In 1914 an American tutor (Miss Mary
E. Forbes) in a princely Himalayan state of Mandi, (now in Himachal Pradesh in
India) began eating a few tender leaves of Centella in salad. After a few months she
never knew what brain fatigue was! It gave relief in rheumatism, neuritis and nervous
breakdown. The villagers in Sri Lanka asserted that the elephants kept their youth and
strength for hundreds of years by regularly consuming this herb (Lucas, 1966).
In Chinese medicine this herb is said to be a brain food and an elixir of long life. It has
ginseng-like rejuvenating and energizing effects on the brain cells and endocrine glands.

For nervous disorders
In nervous debility, 300–600 mg of powder is given thrice daily. A paste prepared
from powders of 5 parts Centella, 4 parts Saussurea and honey is prescribed in a dose of
200–350 mg, three times daily, during speech therapy in children, in insanity and in
hypochondriasis. If this mixture suppresses appetite, calamus is added as a carminative.

202 Mandukparni (Gotu Kola)

For sterility
When Centella was provided as a homoeopathic medicine, a special effect on female
generative organs was observed, indicating its use for sterility. For this purpose equal
quantities of this herb and Trichodesma indicum with half the quantity of sugar was
mixed. Three grams of this mixture was prescribed, twice daily with milk for 3 days,
after menstruation. It is not effective if the patients have obesity, leucorrhoea or
dysmenorrhoea (Ghosh, 1930).

For skin diseases
It is said to bring about kaya kalp – complete rejuvenation of body. It makes the
skin disease-free, lustrous and charming. The plant in the form of juice, pulp, dry
powder, ointment or water extract, is used for various skin diseases, such as chronic
and obstinate ulcers, eczema, psoriasis, sores, elephantiasis, leprosy, scrofula, etc. In
scrofula, the powder of the herb is dusted all over. In leprosy it gives symptomatic relief. In syphilis, when prescribed in the second and third stage, healing of
skin occurs. It is an ingredient of popular hair oil, along with Eclipta alba, Emblica
ofﬁcinalis and sesame oil. This oil is said to help hair growth and make it black and
healthy.

For leprosy
The European physician Dymock in the nineteenth century (Ghosh, 1930) remarked,
“The administration of this drug to lepers causes a sensation of warmth and pricking
in the skin at ﬁrst, especially of the hands and feet. This is followed by a few days of
a general sensation of warmth, sometimes almost intolerable. The capillary circulation is accelerated and after about a week the appetite improves, the skin becomes
softer, throws off the thickened epidermis and recovers its transpiratory faculties.”

In gastroenteritis of infants
The juice of 2 to 4 leaves is prescribed and a paste of the leaves is applied on the naval
region.

For various types of fevers
Equal parts of fresh sacred basil leaves (Ocimum sanctum), black pepper and Centella are
ground to form a paste and on drying made into pills of 2 g each. These are prescribed
three times a day.

Ayurvedic preparations
Brahmi ghrit
Ingredients 1 litre of Centella asiatica juice (if the juice is not available a decoction of
herb is used), 500 g ghee and 30 g each of Acorus calamus, Saussurea lappa and Convolvulus
arvensis.

Mandukparni (Gotu Kola) 203
Method Make a paste by macerating the above powdered herbs in the juice of Centella,
mix it in ghee and warm to a slow to moderate heat, until all the water evaporates.
Dose 5–10 g with sugar followed by sweet, warm milk.
Use As a mental tonic, particularly useful for scholars and students, for mental and
physical fatigue, and in forgetfulness.
Saraswat ghrit
Ingredients 3 litres Centella juice, 750 g ghee and 50 g each of turmeric, jasmine
ﬂower, Saussurea lappa, Ipomaea turpethum, Terminalia chebula, and 25 g each of Embelia
ribes, salt, sugar and calamus.
Method Mix the powdered herbs with Centella juice, ghee, and heat slowly until all
the water evaporates, strain and preserve the fatty matter.
Dose 10–25 g depending on the digestion power. Use with milk.
Use This ghee makes a person intelligent and virile so it is used to increase sexual
power and memory. It is also considered useful in all types of skin diseases.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Bagchi and Puri (1988, 1989) reviewed the literature on various aspects of this herb’s
chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology. The salient features of these and the other
studies are as follows:

As a sedative
Singh et al. (1981) tried the herb with patients suffering from anxiety neurosis. A
six-week treatment not only provided signiﬁcant relief but a quantitative reduction in the anxiety levels, leading to improved mental functions, studied in terms
of mental fatigue and immediate memory span. Experimental studies on the psychotropic effect in rats showed a signiﬁcant barbiturate hypnosis potentiation effect,
besides producing signiﬁcant alternations in the neurochemistry of the brain. The
histamine and catecholamine contents in the brains of the treated group increased
signiﬁcantly.
Agrawal (1981) observed that the alcohol extract of the herb showed a varying
degree of sedation. It prolonged the hypnotic effect of sodium phenobarbitone in rats.
It decreased the acetylcholine and histamine content of the whole brain, while catecholamine was increased. Its effect on the central nervous system resembled that of
chlorpromazine and reserpine. It also had an anti-amphetamine activity. It produced
hypothermia, reduced the motor activity and was a potential neuroleptic. Shukla
(1989) observed a barbiturate hypnosis potentiation effect in different fractions while
Sakina and Dandiya (1990) detected a depressant property in this herb.

204 Mandukparni (Gotu Kola)
Kapoor (1986) found a polyherbal preparation containing Centella quite effective
in insomnia. Kuppurajan et al. (1992) noted that a mixture of Centella, liquorice,
Nardostachys in the ratio of 1:2:2 was more active in psychomotor performance, compared with a well-known tranquillizer, diazapam, and a placebo. The drug was effective
in controlling somatic and psychic anxiety, preferably in old age. In another study
(Kuppurajan, 1995) Ksheerbala tailam (see bala) a mixture of herbs was suspended in
milk and oil emulsion, and dropped on the forehead to see its anxiolytic property. The
preparation was effective in enhancing perceptual discrimination and psychomotor
performance.

Effect on mentally retarded children
Appa Rao et al. (1973) observed that the herb increased the intelligent quotient and
changed the behaviour of mentally retarded children. There was an overall general
adjustment. With the administration of the herb, shy and withdrawn children or those
who were restless became expressive, communicative and cooperative. The herb also
increased concentration power and attention span. In further studies Appa Rao et al.
(1977) observed a signiﬁcant increase in the general mental ability of mentally retarded children after 3–6 months of administering this herb. Sharma et al. (1985)
administered a powder of the herb for six to twelve months to educable, mentally
retarded children within the age range of 8–12 years. These children were followed
for one year. They showed signiﬁcant improvement, with good performance in school.
Nalini et al. (1992) studied the effect of aqueous extract of the herb on learning,
memory and also on levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-HT and their
metabolites in the brain. By using this concentration all of these decreased signiﬁcantly, which showed that all these compounds are involved in learning and memory.
Anbuganapathi (1995) studied the effect of the syrup prepared from Centella and
Bacopa on the learning ability of albino mice and school children and found it quite
effective.

Immunopotentiating effect
When a powder of the herb (3 g/day) was given for three months to patients, it
increased memory, sleep and appetite. It relieved anxiety and mental fatigue (personal
communication). Plohmann et al. (1994) found an immunomodulatery effect in the
triterpenoid saponins of Centella. Praveen Kumar (1996) noted that the oral administration of Brahma Rasayana, containing Centella, signiﬁcantly increased white blood
cell count, bone marrow cellularity, natural killer cells and antibody dependent cellular activity in mice exposed to gamma radiation. It reduced radiation-induced
peroxidation in the liver.

Anabolic effect
When albino rats were fed on a low protein diet and Centella, it prevented mortality
due to gross protein deﬁciency. It increased the blood protein nitrogen and prevented fatty acid inﬁltration of liver. The increase in haemoglobin content was quite
high and statistically signiﬁcant. It decreased the mean level of blood urea (personal
communication).

Mandukparni (Gotu Kola) 205

Anti-cancer studies
Babbu and Padikkala (1993) found that a partial puriﬁed fraction of methanol extract
of the herb inhibited the growth of tumour cells with no toxic effect against
lymphocytes. Babu and Padikkala (1994) studied C. asiatica-induced apoptosis in
Ehrlich Ascites tumour cells. Babu and Padikkala (1995) also studied the role of the
extract of this herb on chemotherapeutic drug-induced toxicity. There was a reduction
in myelosuppression. Babu et al. (1995) observed that the extract destroyed 100 per
cent tumour of the cells in normal human lymphocytes. In follow-up action in animals,
it doubled the lifespan of cancerous mice without any toxicity.

Anti-inﬂammatory effect
Jain et al. (1994) observed an anti-inﬂammatory activity in a polyherbal Ayurvedic
preparation Brahmi rasyana, which contains Centella as well as other herbs.

For ulcers
Centella has been studied for its activity in connective tissue metabolism and endothelial
integrity in various ulcers and venous hypertension. Shin et al. (1982) noted that the
herb, in 93 per cent cases of duodenal and gastric ulcers, exhibited deﬁnite improvement. Grimaldi et al. (1990) also tested it on venous ulcers. Chatterjee et al. (1992)
showed that extract of the herb signiﬁcantly inhibited gastric ulcerations-induced by
cold stress in rats. It increased GABA levels, which were dose dependent. Sarma et al.
(1995) tried an ethanol extract of T. cordifolia and Centella at dose of 100 mg/kg daily.
These had marked protective action against stress-induced ulceration due to the
adaptogenic property of the mixture.

Effect on skin
Bonte et al. (1994, 1995) tested the effects of various compounds from Centella on
collagens. It was seen that both asiaticoside and madecosside stimulated collagen
secretion. Sunil Kumar et al. (1998) applied topically various formulations containing
aqueous extract of Centella to open wounds. It increased cellular proliferation and
collagen synthesis at the wound site. Treated wounds epithelized faster and the rate of
wound contraction was higher, compared to the control.

Anti-ﬁlarial effect
A mixture of ethanol extract of C. asiatica and Acacia auriculiformis was administered to
dogs naturally infected with Diroﬁlaria immitis by Sarkar et al. (1998). It resulted in a
considerable decrease in ﬁlarial count.

Chemical studies
Three principle compounds reported from the herb are asiatic acid, madecassic acid
and asiaticoside. In the body asiaticoside gets transformed into asiatic acid, which is
the most active (Grimaldi et al. 1990). Two saponins are brahmoside and brahminoside

206 Mandukparni (Gotu Kola)

Figure 29 Hydrocotyle javanica, A herb, B dry herb.

and the two triterpenic acids are brahmic acid and isobrahmic acid (Thakur et al.
1989). It also contains essential oil.

Toxicological studies
In high doses it is a narcotic, causing heaviness of the head, headaches and vasodilation,
which may lead to coma. Studies on the compound asiaticoside showed that it is not
very toxic. At higher concentrations it affected the epidermis by keratinization. The
herb caused 20 per cent mortality at a dose of 10 g/kg (Agrawal, 1981). Centella may
cause contact dermatitis on external application (Danese et al. 1994).

Adulterants and substitutes
The Chinese herb Fo-Ti tieng, which means elixir for long life, is obtained from a closely
allied plant, Hydrocotyle asiatica minor, and is sometimes supplied as gotu kola.
A variety of Centella known as thankuni grows in east India. It is smaller than
C. asiatica of Indo-gangetic plains and is less bitter. It is cooked and eaten as spinach.
It is also sold as a genuine herb but is considered inferior.

Mandukparni (Gotu Kola) 207
Mandukparni is a herb with semi-lunar or orbicular leaves so other herbs or plants
with the same types of leaves are sometimes substituted for it. Some of the known
adulterants are: Merremia emerginata Hallier, Syn. Ipomoea reniform Choisy, Evolvulus
emarginatus Burm., Hydrocotyle javanica Thunb. (Figs. 29A & B) and H. rotundifolia
Roxb. (Bagchi and Puri, 1989). Recently a large-scale adulteration of the herb with
Malva rotundifolia has been observed.

Family: Asteraceae (Compositae)
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
These plants are hygrophytic weeds, growing in winter in the warmer part of the
Indian subcontinent. The plant is aromatic, up to 30 cm long with spreading roots.
The leaves are herbaceous, serrate and 2–5 cm long. The inﬂorescence is pink to light
violet in colour and may be up to 2 cm long. The herb has a strong smell and, if
ingested, its excretion can be perceived by the unpleasant smell of urine and sweat.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As per Ayurveda it is light, dry, bitter, sweet, hot, a blood puriﬁer, diuretic, and
sudoriﬁc.

For urinary inﬂammation
In syphilis, when there is acute pain passing urine and the urethra is inﬂamed, a
decoction of the herb is given orally, as well as injected into the urethra. Through this
treatment inﬂammation, swelling and pain subside and urine ﬂow becomes normal.
This treatment also helps these symptoms in women. It relieves various skin diseases
as well. It helps in polyurea, when used for 4–6 months.

For development of the breast
Make a paste of mundi and long pepper with oil, ﬁlter and use it as nasal drops and for
massaging on the breast.

For migraines
Heat the juice of mundi until warm and add black pepper powder to it. Use it before
meals for seven days.

As a Rasayana
A powder prepared from the whole plant or from ﬂowers has a rejuvenating effect and
keeps old age away (Vaidya, 1998). It may be used as follows:
1. For physical strength and as a mental tonic, use the herb with ghee.
2. Root juice of the herb or tea improves youthful vigour, prevents premature greying
of hair and wrinkles on the skin. The same effects are achieved when this herb is
used with an equal quantity of Eclipta.
3. For a spermatogenic effect, the herb is given with sugar.

Ayurvedic preparations

212 Musli

38 Musli

In Ayurveda two types of musli, black and white are recognized.
MUSLI BLACK
Curculigo orchioides Gaertn.
Family: Amaryllidaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The plant grows as an under-shrub in the forests of south and east India. The herb has
3– 4 leaves, 15–50 cm long and 3–5 cm broad, emerging from the soil (Fig. 30A).
Flowers are bluish-yellow in colour, in two rows. The fruits are slightly bigger than
1 cm and oval in shape. The rootstock (Fig. 30B) is straight, about 1 cm thick, black
from outside but white internally, with prominent nodes. The root has a mucilaginous
bitter taste, it is rich in mucilage and contains oleogum resin.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
It is mainly used for diseases of the urinogenital system in both males and females
(Yadav et al. 1974). It may be used as follows:

As a diuretic
It helps in polyurea, dysuria, gonorrhoea, menorrhagia, leucorrhoea and piles.

For erectile dysfunction (impotence)
It is considered a nutritive and aphrodisiac, for which 3–6 g of root powder is given
twice daily.

As a geriatric tonic
It is used for gastroenteritis, hepatitis and as an anti-inﬂammatory agent. For most of
the diseases, 25–50 g of dry root in powdered form is boiled in milk, with sugar

Musli 213

according to taste. In this way it exudes mucilage and has a demulcent activity, which
helps convalescent geriatric patients.
It is also used by pulverizing equal parts of Asparagus racemosus, Curculigo orchioides,
Sphaeranthus indicus, Abrus precatorius and Butea frondosa.
Dose

2–5 g of powder with honey or ghee.

Ayurvedic preparation
Musalyadi churn
Method Pulverize equal quantities of Curculigo, Tribulus, Bombax, Mucuna and Tinospora
(starch).

214 Musli
Dose 10–20 g with milk.
Uses In gynaecological problems due to general debility.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Fan et al. (1996) observed the inhibitory effect of the root on hepatitis virus B replication.
Rao and Mishra (1996) noted anti-inﬂammatory and hepatoprotective activity in it.
MUSLI WHITE
It may be obtained from one or more of the following plants:
Asparagus adscendens Roxb. (Family: Liliaceae)
A. ﬁlicinus Ham.
Chlorophytum arundinaceum Baker (Family: Liliaceae)
C. tuberosum Baker
Roscoea purpurea Royle (Family: Scitaminae)
In commerce the drug consists of white tubular translucent pieces, up to 5 mm
thick and 15 cm long. Before marketing, these are boiled in water and the outer root
coat removed. This process gelatinizes starch and on cooling the root gives a waxy
translucent appearance. When immersed in water the root regains its original shape by
absorbing water. These roots are leathery on chewing, slightly mucilaginous, with a
pleasant taste and smell.
White musli is considered a nutritive tonic and is used in place of Orchis. Tubers
(12 g) boiled in milk are used for sexual inadequacies in both males and females.
Dua et al. (1992) observed adaptogenic activity in Asparagus adscendens, which protects the animals against blood pressure problems following ischaemia.

Neem 215

39 Neem

Azadirachta indica A. Juss
Family: Meliaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is an evergreen tree, growing mainly in south Asian countries, but has recently been
introduced in the other drier parts of the world. Younger trees in dry localities may
become leaﬂess for a month or so in February to March. The leaves are exstipulate,
alternate on a long slender petiole (Fig. 31A). The tree mainly ﬂowers in May or June.
Flowers are whitish pink (Fig. 31D) and fruit 1–2 cm long, ovoid and drupe
(Fig. 31C), enclosing a shrivelled kernel (Fig. 31B).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
A monographic account of this tree has been given by Puri (1999), so only salient
features about neem are given here.
According to Indian mythology, the tree is of divine origin. It originated from
drops of nectar from heaven. The word neem is derived from Sanskrit nimba which
means to bestow health. Other synonyms of this name are: neta – leader of medicinal
plants, pichumarda – antileprotic, ravisamba – has healing effect like that of sunrays,
arishta – resistant to insects, krimighan – antimicrobial, sheetal – has a cooling effect on
the human system. Since ancient times, it came into prominence due to the part it
played in rural daily life in India and for its healing power in chronic and obstinate
diseases. It has been called Village Pharmacy, Heal all, and even Nature’s Drugstore.
In earlier times the patients suffering from incurable and chronic diseases were
advised to live under neem and eat all parts of the tree. Since it is considered cool in its
effect, patients were advised to avoid all things hot in nature like animal products,
alcohol, sex, spices, etc. Milk as a part of the diet was allowed. It was so popular in
ancient India that some scholars think that, at that time, more than 50 per cent of the
Ayurvedic preparations contained neem as an ingredient. In the nineteenth century a
neem bark decoction was used for all types of fever, mainly malaria.
Even today in the Indian sub-continent neem is a household name for treating skin
diseases. It is a common practice to take a bath in the decoction of its leaves or to chew
tender leaves as a blood puriﬁer. The fatty oil obtained from the seed is applied

216 Neem

E leaf and fruit.

externally on skin diseases or is mixed with other ingredients. The stem sap, which is
sometimes exuded by the old neem tree, is very much esteemed for general physiological
health.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Anthelmintic activity
It is effective against a large number of nematodes and in ankylostomiasis. It gave
good results as an ingredient of an anti-ﬁlarial compound.

Neem 217

Anti-microbial activity
It has been used as a disinfectant. Some recent studies have indicated that neem extract
signiﬁcantly inhibited many pathogenic organisms. Bark and leaf extracts suppressed
fungal spore formation and in some cases were fungicidal. This activity may be due to
sulphurous compounds or the limonoid gedunin in the tree.
Neem preparations have schizonticidal activity against various Plasmodium spp.
and Trypanosoma spp., which cause malaria and other protozoal infections. A puriﬁed
fraction of neem oil in a cream base has been found effective in leucorrhoea caused by
Chlamydia trachomatis. It was highly effective in clearing infection from the cervicovaginal region. A cream of neem was effective against Candida albicans, Gardnerella
vaginalis and human papilloma 16 virus infecting the female genital tract. It was prophylactic against septicaemia caused by Salmonella typhi. The water extract of tender
leaves has shown anti-viral activity in some cases, so neem preparations are being tried
against HIV infection.

Anti-diabetic activity
The neem oil and the bitter principle nimbidin have signiﬁcant anti-diabetic activity,
which is comparable to that of sulphonyl urea. Neem oil lowered the blood glucose
levels of normoglycaemic and hypoglycaemic rats.
Some commercial herbal preparations containing neem are available in India for
treating diabetes.

Anti-inﬂammatory activity
It is common practice to use neem oil, or a decoction and poultice made from leaves
and bark, for external application in gout, rheumatism, arthritis, pains, etc. Two bitter
compounds, nimbin and nimbinin, obtained from the oil were comparable to cortisone
in their action. The bark showed anti-inﬂammatory effect due to polysaccharides and
gallic acid.

Anti-tumour activity
An intraperitoneal administration of polysaccharides from bark showed in vitro activity
against Sarcoma 180 ascites tumour. In cases of mouth cancer its cytocidal effect on
malignant cells has been documented. Cytotoxic effects of limonoids have also been
reported.

Anti-ulcerogenic activity
A mixture of neem bitters had anti-gastric activity. It protected patients with Shay
ulceration and duodenal lesions.

Hepatoprotective effect
An Ayurvedic preparation Neemtwagadi kashyam, with neem bark and other herbs, is
speciﬁc for jaundice. In some experiments, neem was found effective for hepatotoxicity.

218 Neem

Immunomodulator property
Earlier anti-stress properties was recorded for neem oil, but recent studies conﬁrmed
that bark has an immunomodulator property. The compounds responsible for the
inhibition of chemiluminescence production by activated human polymorphonuclear
leucocytes have been isolated and identiﬁed. The anti-malarial effect of neem also
appears to be due to the body mobilizing the immune system to suppress infection.

Chemical studies
Recently limonoids have been studied extensively. Azadirachtin is an important compound out of these.

Toxicological studies
Neem preparations have been considered safe because the leaves are used as fodder by
ruminants. Recent studies indicated that extracts of leaf, bark and isolated limonoids
have very low toxicity, but seed oil is not very safe in the prescribed doses.

Substitutes
The neem tree is sometimes confused with China berry, Melia azedarach, but can be
easily differentiated from this tree by leaf morphology and shape of the seed
(Figs. 31D, E).

Peepali

219

40 Peepali

Piper longum L
P. peepuloides Roxb.
P. retrofractum Vahl.
Family: Piperaceae

THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
P. longum is an underground creeper or under-shrub which roots from the nodes
and grows in the sub-tropical climate of the Indian subcontinent. The leaves are
alternate, ovate, 5–12 cm long, acuminate and have a cordate base (Fig. 32A). Flowers
are unisexual, green or yellow with berries (Fig. 32B) crowded in a black spike,
1–2 cm long and 2–3 mm in diameter. When chewed it is greenish, slimy with
a spicy odour and mild pungent smell, slightly different from that of black pepper.
P. peepuloides (Fig. 32C) has a mulberry-like fruiting spike, while in P. longum it is
compact.
The fruiting spike used as peepali is mainly obtained from various cultivars of
P. longum and allied species. Fruiting spikes are aborted in one of the cultivars, which
is known as Navsari peepal in the trade. Another cultivar, growing in east India has
globular fruiting spikes. The fruiting spike of P. retrofractum (Fig. 32D), called bari
peepal (bari is big, in this case fruiting spikes are more than double the size of common
peepali), is probably imported from Malaysia and Indonesia. Some people probably
prefer this because of its bigger size and pungency. The root of Piper species, under the
name peeplamul, is widely used in Ayurvedic medicines. Another Ayurvedic herb called
gaj pipal (gaj means elephant), is also known which has a big fruiting spike. It is
obtained from Scindapsus ofﬁcinalis. The tree Ficus religiosa is also known as peepal, so
sometimes there is confusion between peepal and peepali as both the plants have cordate,
acuminate leaves.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda it is considered a digestant, a Rasayana, sweet, slightly hot, bitter, antikaph and is a laxative. It is said to be useful in bronchial troubles, stomach diseases,
fevers, leprosy, diabetes, piles, arthritis and inﬂammation. The detailed uses of peepali
are:

220 Peepali

D P. retrofractum: fruiting spike.

For respiratory problems
Equal parts of honey with peepali, or double quantity of raw sugar with peepali, helps
fevers and respiratory problems. For coughs with phlegm, fry peepali in ghee and
powder it. Take half a tablespoon of this powder with 1 g of salt and two tablespoons of honey thrice daily. Peepali, when boiled in milk, is a smooth muscle relaxant,

anti-allergic and used for prophylaxis of asthma. Boil one fruiting spike in milk on the
ﬁrst day and eat it with the milk. On the second day take two fruiting spikes, three on
third day and so on, increasing the number every day until intolerable. This treatment
relieves chronic respiratory diseases but may cause heartburn.

For ﬂatulence
Take 1 g of peepali powder and 2 g salt, mix in yogurt and drink. It causes the gas
to escape from the stomach and thus provides relief for motions. It also helps appetite
less.

For piles and haemorrhoids
In piles with or without blood, take 1/2 g of the peepali powder, 1 g of roasted cumin,
add salt as per taste, mix in yogurt milk and drink.

For sciatica
Take half a tablespoon of ﬁnely powdered peepali along with two teaspoons of castor
oil, twice daily.

For obesity
Take 1/2 spoon peepali powder with honey twice daily, for 2–3 months.

For conjunctivitis
Make a ﬁne powder of 5 g peepali and 10 g haritaki. Moisten these powders with water
and after kneading turn it into a candle-like structure and dry. Before use grind this
candle on a wet rough stone and apply the paste onto the eyelids.

For gastroenteritis
Take an equal quantity of peepali and dried young haritaki fruit. Make a ﬁne powder of
these. Take one tablespoon of this mixture.

As an anthelmintic
For worm infestations, one part take peepali powder, two parts raw sugar, mix and take
a dose of half a tablespoon with water.

Ayurvedic preparations

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
Tripathi et al. (1996) reviewed Piper spp. for the phytochemistry and biological activity. The important aspects of this study are given below.

Trikatu
In Ayurveda, a composition consisting of long pepper, black pepper and ginger is very
often incorporated into various formulations under the name Trikatu. In some research
(Atal et al. 1981) it was found that Trikatu enhanced the bioavailability of other therapeutic agents. Zutshi and Kaul (1982) observed that individual members, as well as
Trikatu collectively, increased the bioavailability of vaccines by 300 per cent when orally
ingested. The same effect was seen in long and black pepper, and it was found that
this activity is due to the alkaloid piperine. Lee et al. (1984) carried out a pharmacological study on piperine. Bano et al. (1987) noted that piperine altered the pharmacokinetic parameters of phenytoin. Majumdar et al. (1990) also observed that piperine
makes pentabarbitone more potent and thus increases sleeping time by inhibiting
liver enzymes. Annamalai and Manavalan (1990) also conﬁrmed that Trikatu enhanced
the therapeutic activity by reducing acid secretion and preventing the degradation of
active medicaments by gastric acids. Majeed et al. (1996) patented the use of piperine
for gastro-intestinal absorption and its systemic utilization in nutritional supplements.
Shoba et al. (1998) conﬁrmed that Trikatu enhanced the bioavailability of drugs.

Anti-allergic action
Dahanukar et al. (1984) observed this activity of peepali in childhood asthma when
fed to children both under and above the age of ﬁve. This treatment reduced the
severity of attacks. It reduced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and protected against
antigen-induced bronchiospasm (Dahanukar and Karandikar, 1984).

Vasodilator effect
Shoji et al. (1986) isolated a compound dehydropperonaline from it, which possessed
coronary vasodilating activity.

Analgesic activity
Eun (1986) fed piperine from P. longum to experimental rats to study the mechanism
of its analgesic action. This alkaloid showed profound analgesia, it increased the level
of β-endorphin in the midbrain and decreased opiate binding.

Anti-cancerous property
Reen and Singh (1991) noted that piperine caused the inhibition of pulmonary cytochrome P 450 both in vitro and in vivo. It protected against AFBI-induced cytotoxicity
and micronuclei formation in H4IIEC3 rat hepatoma cells. It markedly reduced the

224 Peepali
toxicity of mycotoxins. It was capable of counteracting AFBI toxicity by suppressing
cytochrome P-450 mediated bioactivation of mycotoxins (Singh et al. 1994).

Anti-ulcer activity
Gursahani and Vasudevan (1994) observed anti-nuclear activity in piperine. Oral
administration of this alkaloid signiﬁcantly inhibited ulceration. It had a protective
action on gastric mucosa.

Hepatoprotective effect
Koul and Kapil (1993) noted that piperine inhibited the metabolism of drugs by the
liver. It also had a liver protective effect.
A marketed Ayurvedic preparation containing Thespesia populnea, cardamum, ginger,
liquorice, long pepper and honey showed marked anti-hepatotoxicity activity in the
laboratory as well as in clinical studies (Shirwalke et al. 1990).

Anti-microbial activity
Kapil (1993) tried piperine against Leishmania donovani, which causes kala-azar or
black fever and found it a potent inhibitor of this pathogen. Ghoshal et al. (1996) found
anti-amoebic activity in P. longum fruit, against Entamoeba histolytica caecal amoebiasis.
The ethanol extract cured 90 per cent of rats.

Anabolic effect
Singh and Guru (1972) noted an anabolic effect in the preparation Pippali Rasayna.
Singh et al. (1973) found analeptic activity in the alkaloids. Tripathi et al. (1989)
noted a thyrogenic response in long pepper. It increased the basal metabolic rates with
signiﬁcant enhancement in the tissue’s oxygen uptake and thyroid peroxidase activity.

In bronchial asthma
Anshuman (1984) tried an Ayurvedic preparation Vardhman Peepali (peepali boiled in
milk) and found it effective for respiratory disorders and in bronchial asthma.

In dysentery
Aggarwal et al. (1994) tried Pippali Rasayana prepared from Peepali and Butea seed for
chronic dysentery and worm infestation. The preparation was tested for anti-giardial
and immunostimulating activity. There was up to 80 per cent recovery from infection.
It did not kill parasites directly but by host resistance, by inducing signiﬁcant activity
on macrophages, as was indicated by increased macrophage migration index and
phagocytic activity. Agrawal et al. (1997) carried out further studies of Pippali Rasayana
on giardiasis. After 15 days of treatment there was complete disappearance of Giardia
lamblia (G. duodenalis) and a reduction of mucus and pus cells. The recovery rate was
92 per cent with no abdominal discomfort.

Peepali

225

In muscular weakness
Dasture (1994) tried two Ayurvedic herbomineral preparations containing Trikatu for
muscular weakness. Both of these potentiated electrically induced contractions. D’Hooge
et al. (1996) observed anti-convulsant properties in piperine. It signiﬁcantly blocked
convulsions induced by receptor agonists.

Chemical studies
It contains 0.7 per cent essential oil, the alkaloids piperine and piplartine, as well as
the other compounds sesamin and pillasterol. In the root, piperine, piplartine and
piperlonguimine alkaloids are present (Thakur et al. 1989).

Substitutes
The roots of Piper longum are well known under the name piplamul. It is said to be mild
but inferior in effect, compared with peepali. It is available in small cylindrical pieces
of nodal and internodal pieces, about 2 mm thick. The nodal pieces are considered
superior to internodal ones.

Punernava 227

41 Punernava

Boerhaavia diffusa L.
Family: Nyctagenaceae

THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a common prostate or ascending creeping weed, purple in colour (Fig. 33A),
which grows throughout the warmer parts of India on sandy and rocky soil. The stem
is thickened at the nodes. The leaves are ovate or suborbicular, rounded at the apex,
2–4 cm long, margin entire, pink, with a base that is rounded to subcordate. Flowers
are very small (4–6mm), in umbels arranged in panicles.
In Ayurvedic literature two types of punernava, red and white, are mentioned.
B. diffusa and the allied species B. repanda and B. erecta with reddish leaves and
commonly with violet pink ﬂowers are considered the source of the red variety
but there is controversy about the correct identiﬁcation of white punernava. At
one stage Trianthema monogyna L., which is a prostate, succulent herb that grows in
the rainy season in damp places and has both pink and white ﬂowers was thought
to be white punernava (Singh and Udupa, 1972a). However B. verticillata R. Br. has
now been identiﬁed as the source of this drug. It is a robust form but very rare
in nature.
Punernava (Fig. 33B) is a woody rootstock, ﬁbrous, twisted like rope, usually less
than 1 cm thick and brownish in colour. When pressure is applied to it, it liberates
white powder which causes a light itching. It has no characteristic taste or smell. To
conﬁrm the source of commercial samples, Surange et al. (1973) carried out a comparative pharmacological study on the genuine root and commercial samples and
found that both have the same activities.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda punernava is used as antidote to toxins, a rejuvenator and a Rasayana as
follows:

For cardiac problems
In oedema, it is given with equal quantities of Picrorhiza, Swertia and ginger. It is said
to have a Digitalis-like effect.

228 Punernava

Punernava 229

For bronchial troubles
For coughs with sputum and inﬂammation, it is given with equal quantities of calamus
and ginger. This medicament causes nausea but clears the bronchial tubes of all
extraneous matter.

For liver problems
The distillate from the herb is considered effective in controlling cirrhosis of the liver.

As a diuretic
It is used for oedema, inﬂammation, nephrotic conditions, jaundice, ascites and for
scanty urine.

Ayurvedic preparation
Punernava mundur
Method Pulverize 200 g of following mixture of herbs in equal quantities: Boerhaavia,
Operculina turpethum, ginger, black pepper, long pepper, Embelia ribes, Cedrus deodara,
Saussurea lappa, turmeric, Plumbago zeylanica, Terminalia bellirica, T. chebula, Emblica
ofﬁcinalis, Baliospermum montanum, Piper cubeba, Holarrhena antidysentrica seed, Picrorhiza
kurroa, Piper longum root, Cyperus scariosus, Pistacia lentiscus, Carum carvi, Ptychotis and
Myrica nagi. Take 400 g of processed iron rust in 1,600 ml of cow’s urine in an iron
pot. (Iron rust is processed by ﬁrst heating it strongly on coal and immersing in cow’s
urine when red hot. This treatment is repeated seven times. The rust is powdered and
mixed with an infusion of Triphala. The whole mixture is dried and heated thirty
times. In the end a brick-red coloured iron compound is obtained.) Boil the rust in the
urine until it is reduced to one-fourth. Add the powder of herbs prepared above to this
rust and heat the whole mixture until it is thick enough for making pills of pea size.
Dose 2– 4 pills twice daily with raw sugar, followed by water.
Uses It is prescribed for hepatic diseases, such as inﬂammation, swelling accompanied by ﬂatulence, mild fever, indigestion, anaemia, spleen enlargement and weakness.
It helps excretion of both urine and faeces, and increases respiratory rate. It stimulates
blood circulation, which results in reduced swellings of the liver and spleen, as well as
reducing oedema.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As a diuretic
The ash of the plant is rich in potassium nitrate and for a long time it was considered
that the diuretic action of the herb was attributed to this (Thakur et al. 1989). Earlier

230 Punernava
studies indicate that punernava increased urinary output but decreased urinary albumin
and speciﬁc gravity. Singh and Udupa (1972 a, b, c) observed that the best results with
this herb were seen in oedema due to renal diseases. It had a urinary antiseptic effect and
improved the pattern of renal recovery. It showed cardiotonic, hypertensive and smooth
muscles relaxant effects. These authors postulated that it increased urine output due to
its cardiotonic effect. The increase in the cardiac output raised the blood pressure,
leading to an increase in the renal blood ﬂow and improved glomerular ﬁltration rate.
It was useful in nephrotic syndrome. The root extract studied by Mudgal (1974, 1975)
had a better diuretic, anti-inﬂammatory property and it improved renal recovery faster.
When given to patients of nephrotic syndrome by Singh (1991), the root, in powder
form, was as effective as cortisone and modern diuretics. Punernava increased serum protein
and immunoglobulin levels but reduced urinary protein excretion (Singh et al. 1992).

As an anabolic agent
Appa Rao et al. (1967, 1969) studied the Rasayana effect of the powdered root on
human volunteers. A moderate decrease in the mean levels of blood urea and serum
acid phosphates was observed. Rajgopalan et al. (1977) observed that it caused nitrogen
retention through its action on the liver, which helped growth and longevity.

Anti-hepatotoxic activity
Chakraborti and Handa (1989) found anti-hepatotoxic activity in petroleum ether,
chloroform and methanol extracts of B. repand root. Rawat et al. (1997) tried powders and
aqueous extracts of various sized roots. The aqueous extract (2 ml/kg) of a root of diameter 1–3 cm, collected in May, was more effective compared with the other root powders.

In ulcers due to stress
Sharma et al. (1991a) observed that the herb protected animals from stress and
haemorrhagic ulcers. It had differential effects on the GABA levels of various regions
of the brain (Sharma et al. 1991b). Mungantiwar et al. (1997) found that the alkaloid
fraction of the root possessed restorative activity against stress-induced changes in
plasma and cortical levels in rats. It signiﬁcantly augmented the antibody production
in stressed rats.

Effect on enzymatic systems
Goswami and Sarma (1992) administered crystalline alkaloids of this herb to experimental animals to study catalase and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. In
the initial stages there was no alteration in catalase activity, but it decreased signiﬁcantly after two hours. ATPase activity, after the administration of the alkaloids,
increased after 45 minutes and reached its peak after 135 minutes.

Cardiotonic effect
Punarnavoside, a new anti-ﬁbrinolytic agent, has been isolated from the root by Jain
and Khanna (1989). A lignan isolated from the roots exhibited a signiﬁcant calcium
channel antagonistic effect in a frog’s heart single cell (Lami et al. 1991).

Punernava 231

In sexual inadequacy
The root powder in a dose of 500 mg, twice daily for 15 days, was effective against
leucorrhoea and spermatorrhoea (Singh, 1991).

Toxicological studies
The ethanol extract was administered twice daily in pregnant female albino rats during the entire period of gestation. It did not have any teratogenic effect or foetal
abnormality (Singh et al. 1991).

Pushkarmul 233

42 Pushkarmul

Inula racemosa Hook f.
Family: Asteraceae (Compositae)
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The herb (Fig. 34A) may grow up to 2 m tall. The leaves are big, 20– 40 cm long and
12–20 cm broad. The outer surface of its leaves are rough, lower hirsuate and margin
dentate. Inﬂorescence is 4–5 cm in diameter. Its root (Fig. 34B) is thick tuberous, horny,
with a slight orris-camphoraceous smell. It grows in the alpine region of the western
Himalayas, along with Saussurea lappa and very often one is substituted for the other.
The Ayurvedic name of the plant, pushkarmul (Pushkar is sun, and mul root in
Sanskrit), is often used in a corrupted form, pohkarmul, in Indian trade. Genuine root is
hard to obtain and very often S. lappa root is supplied instead. Some people consider
orris root obtained from Iris germanica or even I. ﬂorentina a source of pushakarmul,
while others think that I. racemosa is the source of another Ayurvedic herb, rasna
(Chunekar and Pandey, 1969).
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
It is considered a diuretic, stimulant, digestant, anti-inﬂammatory, anthelmintic and
bronchodilator. It causes contraction of the uterus and the respiratory system, relieves
swellings, backache and rheumatic pain. It is an antidote to poison (ama) developed
within the body. For skin diseases such as ringworm and itching, decoction of the root
is used for washing, and the root macerated in cow’s urine is applied externally as a
cataplasm.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

In heart diseases
Tripathi et al. (1984a, 1988) assessed the adrenergic beta blocking activity of
root powder in ischaemic heart diseases. Petroleum ether extract of the root lowered

234 Pushkarmul

plasma insulin and glucose levels within 75 minutes of oral administration. It
counteracted adrenaline and induced hyperglycaemia in rats. Sati and Sharma (1990)
tried it for congestive cardiac failure. Arora et al. (1995) evaluated the cardioprotective activity of the drug in coronary artery diseases, hypertension and diabetes
mellitus.
Pushkar Guggal (2 g), a mixture of Commiphora and Inula, was administered three
times daily for 4 months in angina pectoris and in the management of ischaemic heart
diseases. By this treatment periodical pain, discomfort and dysphonia were controlled.
It decreased mean serum cholesterol (Sharma and Gupta, 1983, Tripathi et al. 1984b,
Sharma et al. 1986a,b, Singh et al. 1991, 1993).
Dwivedi et al. (1987) tried a polyherbal preparation containing pushkarmul, Saussurea
lappa and Terminalia arjuna for heart diseases. It enhanced the aortic prostaglandin
E2.

Pushkarmul 235

In diabetes
Singh et al. (1985) used this root with Cinnamomum tamala leaves and found it to be
very effective for diabetes. Tripathi and Chaturvedi (1995) observed that alcohol extract
lowered blood glucose and enhanced liver glycogen without an increase in plasma
insulin. It may be due to enhanced insulin synthesis. It had no effect on the adrenal
gland. Chaturvedi et al. (1995) studied its effect on glucose levels in albino rats.
Ethanol extract, 400 mg/kg, lowered plasma glucose level four hours after administration. It increased the concentration of liver glycogen and reduced the concentration of
plasma insulin, which returned to normal after four hours.

Hepatoprotective effect
Rao and Mishra (1997) found that the root was effective in liver diseases.

Anti-asthmatic effect
Singh et al. (1980) observed its anti-asthmatic, anti-spasmodic activity. The alcohol
extract of the root protected against bronchiospasms induced by histamines, pollen,
etc.

As a hypolipidaemic agent
It reduced fatty acids, triglycerides, total serum lipids and cholesterol (Ojha et al.
1977). Singh et al. (1993) tried Pushkar guggal on 200 hypolipidaemia patients and
observed good results.

Anti-microbial property
The essential oil from I. helenium was effective against bacteria and fungi (Bourrel et al.
1993). Note: This root also contains inulin, and some of the above pharmacological
activities, as detailed under Saussurea lappa, may be due to this compound.

Chemical studies
The root contains inulin and essential oil. The other active constituent is alantolactone.

Toxicological studies
In large doses it causes nausea and vomiting.

Salai Guggal

237

43 Salai Guggal

Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr.
Family: Burseraceae
THE TREE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The tree grows wild in forests of hilly areas of central India. It has smooth, yellow or
ash coloured bark with alternate, imparipinnate leaves (Fig. 35) which are crowded at
the end of branches. Leaﬂets are sessile and opposite, in 8–15 pairs. Flowers are in
axillary racemes. The fruit is three-angled, splitting into three valves.
Two varieties of the tree have been recognized:
var. serrata with pubescent leaves.
var. glabra with entirely glabrous leaves. (It is sometimes wrongly identiﬁed as B.
glabra.)
The gum is obtained by removing small patches of the bark from the tree trunk.
The resin from the stem, on drying, gets deposited along the sides of the bark after a
few days, and is collected from there. The gum is pooled at collection centres and is
sorted by hand into various qualities. The gum pieces are globular, club shaped,
stalactitic drops of pale yellow to brown, which may coagulate to form bigger lumps.
The gum has a typical odour. In trade the oleo-gum resin is known as Kundru, Dhup,
Loban, Indian olibanum or frankincense. Some times the gum of B. carterii Birdw.
imported from north Africa or Arabia is also supplied as Kundru.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda the gum is considered anti-dysentric, anti-pyretic, and is used mainly in
rheumatism and convulsions, but also in various nervous diseases. It is an astringent
and anti-inﬂammatory agent when applied externally. It is not a constituent of important Ayurvedic products. It is sometimes used as a substitute for guggal gum.

238 Salai Guggal

Figure 35 Boswellia serrata twig.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Tranquillizing property
The non-phenolic fraction of the gum was tried on rats by Menon and Kar (1971).
The animals showed a reduction in spontaneous motor activity and the closing
of eyelids. The rats became alert at the slightest disturbance but returned to a state of
sedation after a few minutes, showing a tranquillizing effect. The non-phenolic fraction
acted like morphine. It produced marked and long-lasting hypotensive activity in
anaesthetized dogs (Kar, 1977).

Salai Guggal

239

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
Pachnanda et al. (1980) administered gum to patients with musculoskeletal rheumatism, including rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and achieved good
results. Gupta et al. (1987) found that defatted alcohol extract was effective against
rheumatoid arthritis and related ailments such as osteoarthritis, juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis, soft tissue ﬁbrositis and spondylitis. The mechanism of action was similar
to the non-steroidal group of anti-arthritic drugs and it was free from gastric irritation and ulcerogenic activity. It improved the blood supply to the joints and restored
the integrity of vessels internally damaged or obliterated by spasms. Singh and Atal
(1986) also conﬁrmed that the alcoholic extract of gum exhibited a marked antiinﬂammatory activity in oedema in rats without any ulcerogenic effect. Singh et al.
(1992) showed that the active constituent, boswellic acid, had a novel mode of action
and formed a new category of anti-inﬂammatory drug. Duwiejua et al. (1993) observed
the anti-inﬂammatory effects. Singh et al. (1996) noted on further studies that boswellic
acid elicited inhibitory action on vascular permeability. It did not have an analgesic
or ulcerogenic effect but had good anti-pyretic activity. Ammon et al. (1992, 1993)
found boswellic acid a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin. It inhibited the formation of 5-lipxygenase products in polymorphonuclear neutrophils in a dose related
manner.

Immunomodulator activity
Sharma et al. (1988, 1996) studied the effect of boswellic acid on cell-mediated and
humoral components of the immune system and its immunotoxicological potential.
It enhanced the phagocytic function of the adherent macrophages. Prolonged oral
administration increased body weight, total leucocyte count and humoral antibody
titres in rats. It was not cytotoxic and did not have immunosuppression effects. Knaus
and Wagner (1996) found that β-boswellic acid, the major constituent of resin, possessed anti-complementry activity in the classical and alternative pathways through
their effects on complement-dependent immunohaemolysis of erythrocytes. A special
extract of gum resin was tried on joint swelling, pain, erythrocyte sedimentation rate
and stiffness. It was found effective in rheumatoid arthritis. Etzel (1996) concluded
that it is not only a good analgesic but a disease modifying agent which could replace
other such products.
A clinical trial of a herbomineral compound containing Withania, Boswellia, turmeric and zinc was carried out on osteoarthritis patients by Kulkarni et al. (1991). It
produced a signiﬁcant drop in the severity of pain and disability score. Another form
of the above preparation without zinc, when tried for 3 months, relieved pain, decreased
morning sickness, and brought about a drop in erythrocyte sedimentation. Radiological assessment did not show any signiﬁcant changes (Kulkarni et al. 1992).

In leukaemia
Shao et al. (1998) observed the inhibitory activity of boswellic acids against human
leukaemia HL-60 cells in culture. It inhibited the synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins
in human leukaemia in a dose-dependent manner.

240 Salai Guggal

In hyperlipidaemia
It decreased serum cholesterol and triglycerides (Zutshi et al. 1986).

Review
Gupta et al. (1987) gave an account of gum chemistry and pharmacology.

Chemical studies
Mainly terpenoids, boswellic acid and other related pentacyclic triterpenic acids have
been reported.

Toxicological studies
The gum extract is safe, well tolerated and can be used in long-term therapy (Etzel,
1996).

242 Salep

44 Salep

Orchis latifolia L.
Syn: Dactylorhiza hatagirea
Family: Orchidaceae
THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
The source of salep is tubers of many species of orchids, such as Orchis latifolia L., O.
laxiﬂora Lam., O. maculata, O. militaris L., O. mario L., O. mascula L., O. pyramidalis L.,
O. sambucina and O. simia L. In Russia, salep is obtained from Orchis spp., Gymnadenia
spp. (Habenaria), Anacamptis spp. and Platanthera spp.
In Turkey and Iran, these tubers have been collected for many centuries and exported
under the Arabic name Sahlep, which changed to salep in Europe and to Salem in India.
Salep has been mentioned in Greek and Roman mythology as a talisman under the
name Satyrion. In western Asian and adjoining European countries, it is very much
valued as a tonic, restorative and aphrodisiac. Gypsies call the root Karengro and use it
as an aphrodisiac and as love amulet. It is highly nutritious. It has a sweetish taste
and unpleasant smell. Salep is said to be hot, humid as per the concept of traditional
healers and so is well esteemed for impotency and nervous disorders in the UnaniTibb (Greco-Arabic system of medicine) where the following varieties of tuber have
been recognized: Salam punja if palm-like, Salam lahsunia if garlic-like, Salam mishri
if translucent and globular like sugar candy and Salam Badshah (Badshah is emperor) if
big or round.
The Sanskrit name of salep is probably munjatak (Trivedi et al. 1974) but this name
is not used now. In India, salep is broadly classiﬁed into salem panja – when it is like
the palm of a hand and salem mishri – when globular or oval. It is obtained from many
orchids but the common sources are: O. latifolia., O. mascula, Eulophia hormusjii Duthie
E. campestris Wall., E nuda Lindll, Habenaria commelinifolia Wall. Ex Lindl., Cymbidium
aloifolium, and Satyrium nepalensis (Puri, 1970). E. hormusjii is of interest because it is a
tuberous orchid which grows in the plains of Punjab and at one time was identiﬁed as
Salam Lahori (after Lahore which is in Pakistan now, earlier it was the capital of united
Punjab). In O. latifolia, the tuber may be palmate or two dichotomously branched
tubers joined together. In E. camapestris, the tuber is irregularly branched and often
lobed, while in E. nuda it is spherical and smooth, like potato. O. latifolia grows
in the Himalayas, while the other Orchis spp and Salam Badshah (Allium macleanii) are
imported to India from Iran and Afghanistan.

Salep 243

Figure 36 Orchis latifolia A herb, B dry root, C Salep, commercial samples.

O. latifolia (Fig. 36A) grows at a height of 3,000–3,500 m in the western Himalayas. It is a small herb, 5–15 cm long, with lanceolate or linear oblong leaves and a
spike about 5 cm long with purple ﬂowers. The bracts are longer than the ﬂowers. In
Kashmir, the herb is known as Narmada, (male female) and in the central Himalayas
Hathjori (like hand). The root (Fig. 36B) is like aconites. The daughter tuber originates from the side of the mother tuber and both the tubers become slightly bifurcated
at the tapering ends so they look like legs. When fresh these tubers may form a human
conﬁguration, very much like that of ginseng tubers.
When the plants mature and the ﬂowers dry, the roots are removed from the soil.
In commercial centres, the tubers are blanched in saline boiling water. When soft
they are peeled by macerating by hand and dried again. This treatment gelatinizes
the starch and gives a waxy, horny texture to the tubers (Puri, 1971a). In commerce

244 Salep
(Fig. 34C) salam mishri tubers are round to oval, dirty white to pale yellow, slightly
wrinkled or smooth, waxy, hard, whereas tubers of salam panja are like a human hand,
1–3 cm long, about 0.5 cm thick and joined at the top. Sometimes potato starch
mixed with acacia gum is made into the shape of salep and boiled in water to
gelatinize the starch. When dry these fake tubers, acquire the texture and shape of the
genuine drug and are used as an adulterant. Keeping this adulteration in mind, Puri
(1971a) provided the pharmacognostic characters of O. latifolia and Eulophia hormuji
(Puri, 1971b) to differentiate genuine tubers from the adulterants.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As a nutrient
The ﬁne powder of the root contains up to 48 per cent mucilage, which becomes thick
and mucilaginous when boiled in milk, so that one teaspoon of salep in a cup of milk
forms a nutritious drink. It is useful for nervous debility, mental and physical exhaustion, hemiplegia and for paralytic affections. It helps weak digestion which is due to
the sluggishness of the digestive system, loose motions and hyperacidity.
In mediaeval times, the sailors used to have 2 teaspoons of salep daily during sea
voyages, boiled in a glass of water and sweetened. It kept their bodies strong and
active. It was also added to sherbet.

For sexual inadequacy
It is an ingredient of many aphrodisiac preparations used for increasing the
quantity, quality and retention time of semen in the body. A recipe is made by
pulverizing 100 g Orchis, and 200 g almond kernel. It is used by both sexes, taking 10 g everyday on an empty stomach in the morning and before sleep in the
evening.

For diabetes
Pulverize 100 g each of Orchis, Chlorophytum, Curculigo and use half a teaspoon twice
daily in the morning on an empty stomach and before retiring in the evening. These
herbs may not act directly on sugar metabolism but will provide energy to the body
due to the loss of sugar absorption.

For leucorrhoea
Make a ﬁne powder of 50 g each of Orchis, Asparagus, Chlorophytum, Curculigo and
Withania. When one teaspoon is used before retiring to bed, there is symptomatic
relief of backache due to leucorrhoea. It can be used after childbirth.

For general lethargy (ﬁbromyalgia)
Salep can be used for any type of body weakness, apathy towards work and sleep,
incapability of doing physical work and exercise, body ache, muscular pains, etc. Make

Salep 245
a ﬁne powder of equal quantities of Orchis and long pepper, take 5 g of it with goat’s
milk, twice daily.

To allay irritation in gastro-intestinal canal
A mucilage is prepared and used by shaking one part of powdered salep with 10 parts
of cold water until dispersed. Add 90 parts of boiling water to it and shake the whole
mass. Drink it like sherbet.

Ayurvedic preparations
Vidyriadi churn
Method Mix 50 g each of ﬁnely powdered Pueraria, Orchis, Withania, Pedalium,
Chlorophytum, and Anacyclus.
Dose One teaspoon twice daily with milk.
Indications It makes the body strong. It helps semen retention, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission and spermatorrhoea.
A slight variation of this preparation is Rativallabh churn, used for the same purpose. (Note: Rativallabh Churn signiﬁcantly differs from Rativallabh Pak.)
Salam pak
Method Take 400 g Orchis, 200 g pistachio, 200 g almond, 100 g Buchanania latifolia
kernel, 100 g walnut, 100 g Chlorophytum, 50 g Pedalium and 20 g each of Withania,
Hygrophila, Asparagus, Pistacia lentiscus oleo-gum resin, Mucuna seed without its seed
coat, 10 g each of saffron, nutmeg, clove, mace, Piper cubeba, bamboo manna, cinnamon, Cydonia vulgaris seed, 1250 g sugar and 400 g ghee. Grind the salep separately
into a ﬁne powder and roast it with a low heat with a small amount of ghee until the
salep turns light brown in colour. Make a paste of the remaining dry fruits and fry
them in the remaining ghee. Make a sugar syrup and add it to the above cooked salep,
dry fruits, herbs and spices. Make candy balls of 20 g each.
Dose 10–20 g as per the digestive power, twice daily, chew thoroughly and drink
milk afterwards.
Use It is used as a winter tonic for all types of sexual inadequacy, mental and
physical weaknesses, laziness and low digestion.
Salam pak forte
For an additional tonic effect and for increasing disease resistance, immunity and
mental power, particularly for middle-aged patients, add to Salam Pak, 10 g Ras sindur
(red sulphide of mercury), 20 g mica compound and 20 g tin compound before
making the candy balls. The dose of Salam Pak Forte should be 10 g or less, compared

246 Salep
with the original preparation is 20 g and it should be used for 60 days, in winter
only.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As a sex tonic
Ageel et al. (1994) studied the effect of ethanol extract of O. maculata tuber on the
sexual behaviour of male rats using a number of tests including penile erection,
homosexual mounting, stretching, yawning, aggressiveness, copulatory behaviour and
orientational activities. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg enhanced sexual arousal in
male rats. It produced a signiﬁcant increase in all the parameters.
Khan and Rehman (1994) tried a polyherbal preparation, with Orchis as the main
ingredient, to study the sexual behaviour of adult male albino rats, at a dose of 500
mg/100 g weight, for ﬁve days. When the treated male rats were exposed to female
rats there was an improvement in their sexual functions.

Chemical studies
It contains 48 per cent mucilage, 2.7 per cent starch, nitrogenous substances (5 per
cent) and a bitter glucosidic substance (Nadkarni, 1954).

Semal Musli

247

45 Semal Musli

Bombax ceiba L.
Syn: B. malabaricum DC.
Salmalia malabarica (DC) Schott. & Endl.
Family: Bombacaceae
THE TREE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a tall deciduous tree, common up to 1,500 m throughout warmer parts of India.
It has a buttressed trunk, with grey bark and sharp conical prickles on the young
stem. The branches are in whorls. Leaves (Fig. 37A) are large with 5–7 lanceolate
leaﬂets, each 10–20 cm long. Flowers (Fig. 37C) are crimson red, 10–15 cm in diameter, appearing before the new leaves. Capsules are dirty brown and when open the
seeds ﬂoat on the air with the help of pappus.
In Ayurveda it is mainly the gum, known as mochrus, and the young root called
semal musli (Fig. 37B) which are used in medicine. Mochrus consists of lustrous brownred particles. Semal musli is obtained from young roots and the adjoining stem pieces
of 1–2 year old trees. It is 5 cm or so thick, dull brick-red in colour with circular
striation and a papery covering. There is no characteristic smell but it has a mucilaginous taste.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The gum is astringent, constipating, a nutrient, anabolic, a blood puriﬁer and strengthens the vital ﬂuid and other vital systems. It is very effective for gastroenteritis and
loose motions. It coagulates the blood and so helps stem bleeding, particularly excessive bleeding during menstruation and pulmonary tuberculosis. It prevents threatened
miscarriage. It is prescribed with ginger, dry fruits, etc. in the form of candies, to
ladies after childbirth.
Semal musli is a geriatric tonic, nutrient, Rasayana, with a stimulating action on the
generative organs. As an aphrodisiac 12 g of root powder with 12 g sugar and 12 ml
of water is taken twice daily.

250 Shankhpushpi

46 Shankhpushpi

Convolvulus pluricaulis Choice
Family: Convolvulaceae
THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
According to Ayurveda, it is a small annual herb, with conch shell-like ﬂowers (shankh
is conch and pushp ﬂower). Three varieties of shankhpushpi, with white, red or bluecoloured ﬂowers, are recognized but the variety with white ﬂowers (C. pluricaulis) is
considered genuine. It is a spreading climber, with a woody stem, 10–60 cm long
branches with trichomes, leaves up to 4 cm long and white or pink ﬂowers. It grows
during the rainy season in the hotter parts of India. The other herbs (Upadhye and
Kumbhojkar, 1993) which are used as shankhpushpi are:
Convolvulus arvensis L. (Fig. 38A)
C. microphyllus Sieb. ex Spreng.
Evolvulus alsinoides L. (Fig. 38B)
Clitoria ternatea L.
Conscorea decussata Schult.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
According to the ancient Indian author Vagbhatta, it is the best of the three herbs in
the Medha Rasayana group used as a brain tonic. It has a cooling effect on the brain.
The herb increases the vital ﬂuid; it is hot in effect, so is a digestive, appetizer and
carminative. It cures skin diseases and is an antidote to poisons. The other uses of this
herb are:

As a mental tonic
The herb is considered good for the brain, it is said to sharpen memory, intellect,
brain power, cure mental diseases and impart deep sleep. It is used as follows:
1. In epilepsy and cerebral ischaemia, use one teaspoon of juice twice a day.
2. The ﬁne powder of the whole herb, one teaspoon twice daily with milk, is a
mental tonic for students and intellectuals.
3. In high fevers, when mental balance is lost, one teaspoon of the powder with
water is given 3– 4 times in a day.

Dose Adults 2 pills, children 1 pill with milk, for 4–5 months.
Uses For increasing mental powers and treating various nervous diseases like insomnia,
depression and high blood pressure.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

In anxiety neurosis
Prasad et al. (1974) tried it for experimental stress. The herb had effect on various
glands through neurohumours, particularly acetylcholine. Mudgal et al. (1977) studied
neurohumoral changes in the body under the inﬂuence of this herb. Mudgal and
Udupa (1977b) noted that the herb had a distinct psychotropic effect, which was
anti-anxiety in its nature, and resulted in improved mental function (Singh and
Mehta, 1977). In other experiments, the herb was found to induce a feeling of
well-being, good sleep, relief from anxiety, nervousness, palpitation and increases in
memory spasm. It caused a reduction in neuroticism and mental fatigue. The herb
showed a signiﬁcant barbiturate hypnosis potentiation effect, a rise in the levels of

Shankhpushpi 253
5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, and a reduction in the levels of acetylcholine and
catecholamine in all brain tissue (Singh et al. 1977a, b). Because of these activities,
the herb was used before anaesthesia (Deshpande and Lalta Prasad, 1978). Shukla
(1981) recommended it as an anti-anxiety agent. Sinha et al. (1989) put forth the
view that the memory potentiation and learning effect of the herb may be due to
protein synthesis. The herbs collected during spring showed the maximum hypnosis
potentiating activity (Mishra et al. 1995).

Hypotensive effect
Mudgal et al. (1972), Mudgal and Udupa (1977a) observed maximum activity in the
leaves.

In Fabry’s disease
Goldman et al. (1996) postulated that the nortropane alkaloid isolated from this herb
was a glycosidase inhibitor and may be of help in Fabry’s disease, which is caused by
lack of α-galactosidase activity.

Anti-ulcerogenic effect
Purohit et al. (1996) observed that the alcoholic extract of the whole plant of E.
alsinoides signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of ulcers.

In schizophrenia
An indigenous psychotropic preparation made from the extracts of E. alsinoides, Centella,
Withania, Glycyrrhiza, Saussurea, calamus, Rauvolﬁa and Myristica, in a dose of 100 mg
was tried on untreated schizophrenia patients. It showed improvement in 50 per cent
cases without side effects (Parikh et al. 1984). In patients of depressive illness, a dose
of 25 ml Shankhpushpi syrup showed a positive anti-depressant effect (Kushwaha and
Sharma, 1992). It also helped in catatonia (Purohit et al. 1996).

Intercation with phenytoin
A polyherbal Ayurvedic preparation containing Convolvulus pluricaulis, Centella asiatica,
Nepeta hindostana, N. elliptica, Nardostachys jatamansi and Onosma bracteatum reduced the
anti-epileptic activity of phenytoin (Dandekar et al. 1992).

Chemical studies
Tropane alkaloids like pseudotropine, polyhydroxy tropanes, tropinone and pyrrolidine
have been isolated (Todd et al. 1995).

Toxicological studies
Horses exhibited weight loss, colic and vascular sclerosis of the small intestine when
grazed on C. arvensis (Todd et al. 1995).

It is a small shrub or a woody climber and grows in all parts of India at a low altitude
in the shade and in tropical climates. The rootstock has fascicled tuberous roots.
Branches are angular, leaves (Fig. 39A) reduced to spinescent scales and 0.4–0.6 mm
long. Flowers are white, solitary, clustered in a raceme. The fruit is a subglobose berry
with 1–6 smooth black seeds.
The roots of A. adscendens Roxb. (Fig. 39D) and A. gonoclados Baker (Fig. 39E) are
also known as shatawari. A. sarmentosus Willd. has a bigger root so is called mahashatwari
or big shatawari. A. ﬁlicinus Ham. which grows in the temperate Himalayas and has a
bunch of tuberous roots is sometimes used as shatawari but is a source of another
Ayurvedic root, safed musli.
The root is dried after harvesting and may be boiled, peeled and cut into pieces.
The root is very rich in mucilage and on pulverizing, the powder forms hard lumps by
absorbing moisture.
In trade there are two varieties, one is pale brown, slightly resinous and said to
come from Nepal (Fig. 39B) whilst the other is dirty white, horny, spongy and probably
from south India (Fig. 39C). The Ayurvedic physicians prefer the root from Nepal as
it is said to be more effective.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
According to Ayurveda, shatawari is heavy, cold, bitter, nutritive; it relieves vata and
pitta and is a Rasayana. In pitta 5 g of this root with honey and ghee is given twice
daily. It helps fatigue, insomnia, weakness, laziness and in urinogenital disorders. In
vata take an equal quantity of Asparagus and long pepper and use 5 g with honey twice
daily.
In kapha use Shatawari pak – a compound preparation.

Shatawari is said to help intelligence and weak eyesight. It is a blood puriﬁer and an
antiinﬂammatory agent. It is an important ingredient of many Ayurvedic formulations, mainly used for proper development of the body to make it more energetic. The
major uses of shatawari are:

During pregnancy
It is used for breast development, proper embryonic growth and to rid genital organs
of diseases. In the ﬁrst eight months of pregnancy, it is prescribed in a powder form
orally, but during the ninth month a swab of cotton dipped in oil made from Asparagus
is inserted into the vagina daily before sleep. It acts as a lubricant, makes vaginal muscles
strong and elastic, which helps a painless delivery.

Shatawari 257

For leucorrhoea
Mix 5–10 g powdered Asparagus with equal amount of ghee, swallow it and drink
sweet, warm milk afterwards. Continue this treatment twice daily for 40 days.

As a galactagogue
Five to ten gram of Asparagus powder followed by warm milk is recommended to
pregnant ladies and to lactating mothers during the lactation period.

For dry coughs
For both infants and mothers, take equal quantities of powdered Asparagus, Adhatoda
leaves and sugar. Before use, boil 10 g of this mixture in 200 ml of water and when
the water is reduced to half, ﬁlter to remove insoluble matter. Boil the decoction
further until reduced to one-fourth (50 ml). For mothers the dose is 2–3 teaspoon of
the decoction, and for infant 3– 4 drops, three to four times a day.

For throat problems
Pulverize equal quantities of the roots of Asapargus, Acorus calamus and Sida cordifolia.
Use 5 g of this powder, 2–3 times a day.

Ayurvedic preparations
A galactagogue
Each capsule contains extracts of 200 mg Asparagus, 100 mg Withania, 50 mg
Glycyrrhiza, 50 mg Trigonella and 20 mg garlic.
Dose One capsule three times a day.
Use It develops breasts (Sholapurkar, 1986). After childbirth it stimulates lactation
and increases the milk yield.
Shatawari Pak
Ingredients 100 g each of Sida cordifolia, Asparagus and Cassia tora; clove, cardamom,
nutmeg, mace, raisins, 200 g almond, 1 kg sugar made into thick syrup, 900 g milk
solid matter (condensed milk) and 450 g ghee.
Method Make a ﬁne powder of the ﬁrst three ingredients. Separately roast the condensed milk in ghee until brown in colour, add the sugar syrup and heat some more to
further dry the mixture. When still hot add the powdered herbs, spices and chopped
dry fruits. Stir the whole mass for some time. When still warm, make candy balls of
20–25 g each.
Dose As per digestive power, 20–25 g in the morning with milk.

258 Shatawari
Use It makes both male and female bodies strong. This preparation increases the
bioavailability of shatwari to the patients.
Shatawari ghrit
Ingredients 400 ml Shatawari juice, 400 ml milk, 200 g ghee, Astvarga (eight herbs
used together, see Chavanprasha under amalaki for their names), black grapes, Uraria
picta, Desmodium gangeticum, Glycyrrhiza, Pueraria tuberosa and Pterocarpus santalinus, all
in equal quantities. (Note: If Asparagus juice is not available then steep 400 g of dry
Asparagus powder in 800 ml of water and keep for 24 hours. Macerate the root in
water and pass through muslin – this ﬁltrate is equivalent to juice of Asparagus.)
Method Grind the herbs, make a thick paste of these with juice, add 25 g each of
sugar and honey. Cook all the herbs in milk and ghee until all water evaporates and
only fatty matter is left. On cooling, mix the remaining sugar and honey.
Dose 1–2 teaspoon with milk in the evening.
Uses It is an aphrodisiac and is beneﬁcial to the sexual systems of both males and
females. For males, it is spermatogenic, imparts strength, increases the retention time
of ejaculation and dissipates excess body heat. In females, it helps pain and inﬂammation
due to vaginal diseases. It regularises menstruation, helps dysmenorrhoea and conception.
According to an Ayurvedic concept, normal conception does not take place in some
women because of excessive body heat. This preparation helps conception by keeping
the sperm alive for longer due to its cooling effect.

Contraindications
Any activity which generates body heat, for example non-vegetarian or heavy food,
meals which are hot in nature, tobacco, sleeping during the day, excessive work, sexual
intercourse and exercise.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

In ulcers
Kishore et al. (1980) tried the root in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. There was
a deﬁnite cure in many cases. It also helped hyperacidity. When Dahanukar et al.
(1983) tried Asparagus with Terminalia chebula, they found that the preparation had a
cytoprotective effect on gastric mucosa in acute gastric ulceration. Duodenal ulcers
were prevented and the ulcer index was diminished. Dahanukar et al. (1986) found it
to have a protective effect against abdominal sepsis. When Singh and Singh (1986)
tried 12 g of root, in three divided doses, for six weeks on duodenal ulcer patients, it
relieved symptoms in most of the cases. Pande and Rajgopalan (1994) found the herb
effective in acid dyspepsia with or without ulcers. Bharti Mahashweri and Tewari

Shatawari 259
(1996) prescribed 20 g of the root, in three divided doses, with milk for one month,
to duodenal ulcer patients. Some were suffering from hyperchlorohydria and
hyperacidity, whilst other had normal levels of gastric acidity. This treatment reduced
both total acid and free hydrochloric acid in all the patients.

Immunomodulating activity
Thatte et al. (1987) observed that pre-treating patients with Asparagus produced leucocytosis, indicating the herb has an immunomodulating property. It brought immunotherapeutic modiﬁcations of E. coli-induced abdominal sepsis. In another preparation Seena
et al. (1993) also noted that shatawari might be playing the role of an immunomodulator.

Galactagogue activity
Tennekoon et al. (1987) observed this activity in Asparagus falcatus. Vihan and Panwar
(1988) fed shatawari to lactating goats to study the galactagogue activity. There
was substantial increase in milk yield by a dose of 100g /kg/day of shatawar powder.
Khurana et al. (1996) gave a preparation containing Leptadenia, Nigella, fennel, Pueraria,
Glycyrrhiza, cumin and Asparagus to healthy buffaloes. It resulted in signiﬁcant increase in milk yield. The effect was evident after 7 days, peaked on the 21st day and
was sustained for 35 days.

In male infertility
Samanta (1992) studied the modulation of male infertility by Asparagus, Astercantha
and Curculigo, by prescribing 8–10 g per day of a mixture of these herbs, divided into
three doses with milk and sugar, for three months to patients with oligospermia,
necrospermia and with less motile, unhealthy sperm. After one month of treatment
some changes in sperm morphology were observed. There was a considerable improvement in the number and motility of the sperm, and immaturity was reduced. After
three months the sperm became normal in 80 per cent of patients.

In nausea and vomiting
Siddiqui and Hakim (1994) prescribed a 6 g mixture of Asparagus, Amomum subulatum,
Carum carvi and Glycyrrhiza extract in two equally divided doses for 6 weeks. Relief
from pain and burning in epigastrum, nausea and vomiting, and distension of abdomen was observed.

Anti-tumour activity
Sekin et al. (1994) mentioned that a polycyclic alkaloid from this root showed antitumour activity on various tumour models in vitro. The same alkaloid also showed
anti-oxytocin activity in vitro (Sekin et al. 1995). Shao et al. (1996) observed that the
crude saponins from the root inhibited the growth of human leukaemia cells in culture,
in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Saponins were cytostatic at low concentration
but at higher levels the effect was cytocidal. Dhuley (1997) studied the effect of
A. racemosus on the function of macrophages obtained from mice treated with the

260 Shatawari
carcinogen ochratoxin A. The chemotactic activity of murine macrophages was signiﬁcantly decreased. The production of interlukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor was also
markedly reduced.

As a general tonic
Dhatriyadi yoga, a polyherbal preparation containing Emblica ofﬁcinalis, Asparagus and
Nardostachys grandiﬂora, when given to pregnant women, maintained optimal levels of
haemoglobin and serum protein. The preparation was quite safe and as effective as an
allopathic tonic (Dwivedi and Tewari, 1991).

Chemical studies
Asparagus contains steroidal sapogenins and steroidal glycosides.

262 Som Ras

48 Som Ras

In Rig-Veda, one of the oldest repositories of human knowledge, a long-cherished
substance of the vedic people, somras, the soma juice, is mentioned. Out of over 1,000
hymns in Rig-Veda, 120 are devoted exclusively to soma. It was a god-narcotic of
ancient Indians, which attained an exhalted place in the magico-religious ceremonies
of the Aryans (Schultes and Hofmann, 1992). For a long time, it was considered by
some to be a herb, the juice of which could lead to the attainment of superhuman
power. It was a divine bliss, which gave pleasure to human beings. It was a juice of
immortality, comparable to present day tonics, ambrosia, nectar, elixir, panacea or the
most recently introduced adaptogens, smart drugs or mood elevators. According to
Schultes and Hofmann (1992) when the culture changed from hunting to pastoralism
and agriculture, the use of soma died out and was forgotten long ago, so its source
became a mystery.
The source of soma, on the basis of vague descriptions given in ancient texts, was
identiﬁed as a dark coloured, leaﬂess milky sap-containing creeper. These characteristics resembled Periploca aphylla (Fig. 40A) and Sarcostemma brevistigma (Fig. 40C) of the
Asclepiadaceae family but these herbs lacked the physiological effects on the human
body ascribed to soma, so some authors thought that it might be from hallucinogenic
plants such as Cannabis or Peganum harmala, or a stimulant like Ephedra vulgaris
(Fig. 40B) (Puri, 1977).
Wasson (1972), after an extensive ethnobotanical study of hallucinogenic fungi of
South America, considered soma to be the ﬂy agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria (Fig.
40D), family Amanitaceae. This fungus is found in the western Himalayas at an
altitude of approximately 2,000 m in the rainy season on rotting organic matter.
When mature, the fructiﬁcation is crimson red in colour and looks like a beautiful
ﬂower. Insects are attracted to it by its colour and get killed on contact, due to the
fungus’s poisonous nature. The crimson umbrella has white scales and contains the
remains of dead insect bodies. When fully mature the fructiﬁcation is 7–20 cm in
diameter, the central stalk is 20–25 cm long with a broad bulbous base and has
numerous hair-like ﬁbres spread all over the soil. The stalk is on off-white colour,
ﬂeshy when young but becoming horny on maturity. The base of the stem has white
valves adhered to it. On the ventral side of the umbrella are numerous gills, which
enclose spores and disperse them on maturity.
Wasson (1972) provided coloured photographs of all the developmental stages of
ﬂy agaric and compared them with the descriptions given in the vedas. The author also
concluded that the use of soma was comparable to the hallucinogenic fungi used by
some tribes of Mexico for religious rites. A soma-like drink is still consumed in some
areas of Central Asia and Siberia, the areas from which Aryans probably migrated to India.

D Amanita muscaria (diagrammatic).

Chemical studies
It contains hallucinogenic compounds like muscimol, muscarin, ibotenic acid and
tropane alkaloids. During the drying of ﬂy agaric, ibotenic acid changes to muscimol
(Schultes and Hofmann, 1992).

Toxicological studies
In small doses Amanita extract relaxes the body and imparts peace of mind but after
some time the hallucinogenic effect begins. The body becomes semi-conscious with

264 Som Ras
the stimulation of the nervous system, vivid dreams, recollection of old memories and
supernatural feelings. Long-term use of this herb is harmful.

49 Sonth

Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe
Family: Zingiberace
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It grows in hot, humid, sub-tropical climates in many parts of the world. The herb
has broad leaves, arising from the ground (Fig. 41A). It rarely ﬂowers. The fresh root
is called adrak and the dried root sonth in most parts of India (Fig. 41B). Before
drying, the rhizome is boiled in water and the outer corky layers are scrapped.
It is cut longitudinally and dried. Sometimes calcium is added to the water before
boiling.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As per Ayurveda, it is pleasant anti-ama, anti-vata, digestant, pungent, light, oily, hot
in effect, laxative and anti-inﬂammatory. It makes food tasty and increases vital ﬂuids.
It helps bronchial troubles, nausea, vomiting and heart diseases.
Throughout the whole of Asia, from China to Turkey, ginger has a reputation of
being a powerful aphrodisiac. A masticate of a mixture of ginger, cinnamon, Piper
cubeba and Anacyclus pyrethrum is often recommended for this purpose. Ginger juice is
an aphrodisiac if taken with honey and half boiled egg at night for a month. It is said
to strengthen the sex organs and cure impotence.
In traditional Chinese medicine dry ginger rhizome is used to expel interior cold,
while fresh ginger disperses exterior cold (Bone, 1997).

Sonth 267
Dose Half to one ball with one teaspoon of ghee, twice daily with milk, for 90 days.
Use It makes women’s bodies strong and healthy, giving them a good shape.
It increases breast size and cures diseases of the generative system. It clears pimples,
acne, blemishes, etc. from the face and makes the skin smooth and lustrous. If used by
lactating mothers, the breastfed infant receives all the beneﬁcial effects of ginger.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
It is used in tonic preparations for women, mainly after conﬁnement. It is an antioxidant, anti-microbial and acts as a preservative. Puri (1988) and Bone (1997) have
given a review of the medicinal uses of ginger. The important points given in these
articles and additional information are as follows:

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
Ginger extract reduced swelling and was as active as aspirin. Patients suffering from
rheumatoid arthritis received relief using it. The pungent active constituent, gingerol,
inhibited prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis (Kiuchi et al. 1992). It was a more
potent inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis than indomethacin. The essential oil of
ginger inhibited chronic adjuvant arthritis in rats (Bone, 1997).

As a digestive agent
Ginger has a proteolytic enzyme action similar to papain. It has a stimulating action
on bile, saliva production, gastric secretion and helps digestion by increasing metabolism
(Sambiah and Srinivasan, 1989, 1991).

Anti-ulcer activity
It inhibited experimentally-induced gastric ulcers. Through its anti-microbial activity
it prevented ulceration and inhibited the manufacture of prostaglandin (Bone, 1997).

As an anti-microbial agent
It was effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in various
culture experiments. At the dose of 3 g, thrice daily, it had a signiﬁcant effect on
Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia spp. Anti-viral, anti-fungal, anthelmintic, anti-ﬁlarial
and molluscicidal activities have also been observed (Bone, 1997, Billing and Sherman,
1998).

As a cardiotonic
Ginger has a tonic effect on the heart’s action (Shogi, 1982). It can increase blood
pressure by restricting blood ﬂow in the peripheral area of the body. It has antiplatelet activity and a positive inotropic effect (Bone, 1997).

268 Sonth

For lowering cholesterol
It lowered cholesterol both in the blood and in the liver by impairing its absorption.
It suppressed appetite, which further decreased cholesterol intake (Giri et al. 1984,
Bhasakar et al. 1984). The effect was not immediate. Tanabe et al. (1993) isolated a
compound from ginger, which had an inhibitory effect on cholesterol biosynthesis.

In hepatotoxicity
It countered liver toxicity by increasing bile secretion (Sambiah and Srinivasan, 1991).

Anti-tumour effect
Ethanol extract showed a biphasic effect on the secretion of cytokines by human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro (Cheng et al. 1995).

Anti-emetic effect
Many studies have shown that it increased bile secretion, prevented nausea and motion
sickness. It had central nervous system depressant, cough suppressant, anti-vomiting,
anti-convulsant and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition properties (Bone, 1997).

As an immunomodulator
Ginger had a stimulating effect on the immune system (Bone, 1997).

In migraine headaches
It helped neurological disorders, particularly migraines (Mustafa and Srivastava, 1990).

As an anabolic agent
In malabsorption syndromes, it improved body weight, appetite and increased
haemoglobin percentage (Nanda et al. 1985, 1993).

Hypo-uricaemic effects
Maheshwari et al. (1995) administered water and alcohol extract of ginger for 30 days
and observed a signiﬁcant fall in the level of serum uric acid. Alcohol extract was more
effective.

Chemical studies
It contains 1.0–2.5 per cent essential oils, pungent principles gingerols and shogaols
(Bone, 1997).

Toxicological studies
It should be used with care during pregnancy.

Hygrophila spinosa T. And.
Syn: Astercantha longifolia Nees.
Hygrophila auriculata (Schum.) Hiene
Family: Acanthaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a spinescent herb (Fig. 42) which grows in marshy land, along rivers and in ponds
in warm areas. It may grow up to 1 m tall, with yellow, sharp spines up to 2 cm long.
The leaves are coarse, lanceolate, in a spiral of six, of which the outer two leaves are
longer, maybe up to 20 cm long, while the inner four leaves are 4 cm long. Flowers are
bluish to violet, about 3 cm long and in pairs of four. The fruit is ﬂat, 8 mm long,
rectangular, sharp, consisting of 4–8 seed. The seeds are red and hirsuate. When
chewed the seeds are tasteless but there is a secretion of tenacious mucilage.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The seed is considered diuretic, a tonic, augmentative, an aphrodisiac and spermatogenic. It is used for inﬂammation and allied diseases of the liver, urino-genital
problems and sexual inadequacies. It affords strength, virility and increases seminal
retention ability. The seed is hard to digest, causes constipation and so is used with
milk and sugar.
In general debility and impotency, 10 g of talamkhana seed with an equal quantity
of processed Mucuna seed or a powder of 10 g each of talamkhana, gokshru and shatawari
is prescribed with milk.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL

272 Tulsi

51 Tulsi

Ocimum tenuiﬂorum L.
Syn. O. sanctum L.
Family: Lamiaceae (Labiate)
In scientiﬁc literature, the name Ocimum sanctum is commonly used for this herb. The
same has been followed in this book. It is also known as Holy basil or Sacred basil.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is grown in most Hindu houses and is worshipped. Tulsi is allocated sixth place
amongst eight objects of worship in Hindu rituals. It is satvik, having spiritual uplifting qualities. Five types of tulsi have been recognized in ancient texts. Of these Ram
(green) and Krishna (black) are varieties of O. tenuiﬂorum. The identiﬁcation of other
types is doubtful.
The herb (Fig. 43) is very branched, slightly woody and often pale purple in colour.
The leaves are ovate, elliptic, oblong, 3 to 4.5 cm long and 1.5 to 2 cm broad, hairy,
with minute dots and margin entire. Flowers are purple-pink and whorled in racemes.
The herb survives only in a warm climate in summer.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Tulsi is widely prescribed for diseases due to vata. The other uses are:

Antidote to poisons
Tulsi destroys the poisons (ama) generated in the body due to irregularities in dietary
habits, indisciplined lifestyle, lack of self control or weakness. It is also an antidote for
environmental pollutants.

For skin diseases
External application of the leaf paste helps minor skin infections, such as acne, etc.

Tulsi 273

For incurable diseases
It is helpful in diseases such as cancer and high blood pressure. If a rigid regulated
lifestyle is followed, it may be effective in leukaemia.

274 Tulsi

As a general tonic
The juice is sharp and bitter. It stimulates the digestive system, prevents vitiation of
blood, rejuvenates the body, increases vital ﬂuid (semen) and cures nervous weakness.
Five grams of the leaf juice, twice daily has a Rasayana-like effect.

As an anti-stress agent
Tulsi, in the form of a tea, helps stress-related diseases due to physical, chemical or
biological causes. It is particularly useful for peptic ulcers, heart diseases, hypertension,
colitis, post-operative complications and even asthma.

As a brain tonic
Tulsi beads have long been used for mental peace. Tulsi leaves improve memory by
stimulating brain activity. It helps forgetfulness and irregular delirium. Through its
use mentally retarded children show noticable improvement. As a brain tonic, swallow ﬁve leaves in the morning with water or crush 10 tulsi leaves, 5 black peppers and
4 almonds and mix in honey.

As an aphrodisiac
Various recipes for this purpose are:

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Immunomodulator activity
Tulsi has an immunosuppressing effect and modiﬁes host resistance to a number of
conditions including allergic, infectious disorders and stress-induced changes (Godhwani
et al. 1988, Mediratta et al. 1988).

Effect on the nervous system
Sakina et al. (1990) studied the effect of an ethanol extract fraction on the central
nervous system (CNS). All the actions resembled those of low doses of barbiturates.
It could reduce the severity and duration of electric shocks, and pentylene tetrazoleinduced convulsions. It decreased the apomorphine-induced ﬁghting response. Singh
et al. (1991) studied the biochemical changes brought about by tulsi during stress.
Ahumada et al. (1991) observed the depressing effect of the extract on the mouse
nervous system. There was a signiﬁcant increase in the narcosis time, which was dose
dependent. It had a clear synergism with pentobarbitol in depressing the mouse’s CNS
response. It also had an anti-spasmodic effect. The crude aqueous extract potentiated
hexabarbitone-induced hypnosis in rats. Singh and Agarwal (1991) tried it against
induced pre-convulsive dyspnoea. Volatile oil from the leaves and ﬁxed oil from the
seed was effective. These also inhibited hind paw oedema in rats. Singh and Majumdar
(1995) noted that the analgesic activity of the herb’s ﬁxed oils was related to the

Tulsi 277
peripheral system and was not centrally mediated like morphine. The effect may be
due to prostaglandin inhibition.

Anti-pyretic activity
Tandan et al. (1989) observed that the essential oils had signiﬁcant anti-pyretic activity.

Hypotensive effects
Subbulakshmi and Sarvaiya (1991) noted this effect.

Adaptogenic properties
Bhargava and Singh (1981) and Dadekar et al. (1988) noted anti-stress activity in the
herb, while Singh et al. (1989) studied it for anoxia tolerance. Ahumada et al. (1991)
observed an adaptogenic effect in-induced narcosis in rats. It enhanced the physical
endurance and survival time, and protected against modulated humoral immune responses. Bhattacharya et al. (1994–1995) studied the modulation of blood sugar levels
in stress-induced rats by this herb. Trivedi et al. (1995) carried a clinical evaluation
of the leaf powder for laryngo-pharyngitis, bronchial asthma and in stress-related
hypertension. It was found to be a highly efﬁcacious immunomodulator in humans. It
increased cell-mediated immune response. Kozlovskaya (1996) studied the psychotropic
effects of an essential oil and water extract on the behaviour of rats under acute
emotional stress and on the status of the lymphoid organs (thymus, adrenal glands and
spleen); both the water extract and essential oil had a similar effect in correcting
behavioural as well as somatic reactions to stress. Sadekar et al. (1998) carried out
research on the immunomodulating effect of dry leaf powder on humoral response in
poultry, naturally infected with infectious bursal disease, IBD virus. The powder had
a positive immunostimulatory effect and it overcame the immunosuppressive effect of
the IBD infection.

Anti-ulcerogenic effect
Singh et al. (1991) observed the slowing effect of the herb on intestinal transit, which
may be useful in emotional tension where intestinal motility is usually increased. This
was attenuated to different degrees. Mandal et al. (1993) observed that the administration of the leaves reduced the ulcer index, and both free and total acidity in acute and
chronic cases. Pre-treatment for seven days increased mucous secretion.

In skin diseases
Savargaonkar et al. (1990) tried a mixture of tulsi and Nyctanthes arbor-tristis on eczema
by applying it externally. Bantwal and Mardikar (1990) clinically tried the black
variety of the herb on leprosy patients.

Hypoglycaemic effect
The leaf extract was studied using normal and diabetic rats (Chattopadhaya, 1993).

278 Tulsi

Anaphrodisiac effect
Kantak and Gogate (1992) noted that higher doses of the leaves decreased the sexual
behaviour of animals.

As an anti-cancerous agent
Prashar and Ashok Kumar (1995) investigated the chemopreventive activity of the
ethanol extract of leaves against 2,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) induced
papillomagenesis in the skin of mice. The extract had signiﬁcant anti-neoplastic activity.

Radioprotective effect
Uma Devi and Ganasoundari (1995) studied the radioprotective effect of water or
aqueous ethanol extract of the leaves before complete exposure of the body to gamma
radiation in albino mice. Water extract was more effective than hydroalcohol menstrum.
Intraperitoneal administration of these extracts gave the best protection. Furthermore
Ganasoundari et al. (1997a,b) studied the modiﬁcation of bone marrow radio sensitivity.
An aqueous extract of the leaves was found to protect mice against lethal radiation levels.
Ganasoundari et al. (1998) observed that the leaf extract enhanced bone marrow radioprotection and toxicity. Pre-treatment of tissues with tulsi resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease
in aberrant cells as well as different types of aberrations. It also acted as a detoxiﬁer.

Anti-haemorrhagic effect
Jangde et al. (1996) noted that the aqueous and alcoholic extract of leaves signiﬁcantly
reduced the duration of bleeding in rabbits. The alcohol extract was more effective.

Antioxidant effect
Eugenol, one of the main ingredients of tulsi essential oil inhibited the accumulation
of lipid peroxidation products in red blood cells, and maintained the activities of
antioxidant enzymes. It protected free radical attack on the membrane and maintained
the activities of antioxidant enzymes (Kumaravelu et al. 1996).

Chemical studies
The essential oil from the whole plant contained 71.3 per cent eugenol, 3.2 per cent
carvacrol, 20.4 per cent methyl eugenol and 1.7 per cent caryophyllene.

Acorus calamus L.
Family: Araceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
This herb originated in east Europe and adjoining areas. In India it grows in marshy
and humid land in many places. It has sword-like leaves (Fig. 44A), arranged in a
rosette, from the centre of which a bunch of blue or violet ﬂowers may arise, hence the
name blue ﬂag. The root is about 1 cm thick, spreads prostrate within the soil and has
distinct nodes and internodes. Numerous root ﬁbres arise all over the internodes.
During collection, the root (Fig. 44B) is removed from the soil, cut into 5 cm long
pieces and dried. On drying it becomes rather ﬂat with longitudinal striations. The
central vascular portion is darker than the rest of the root. It has a distinct strong
aromatic odour.
In Indian it is known as vacha or ghorvacha and it is distinguished from balvacha or
parsik vacha (khurasani vacha) which does not have a central darker portion and is white
throughout. It is obtained from Iris germanica L, which is cultivated in graveyards of
Muslims in Kashmir. It is said that the root’s smell keeps predators (rats) away, which
would otherwise prey on the dead bodies. Tuberous roots of Paris polyphylla are also
considered a source of this commodity.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
Since antiquity, calamus root has been used for medicinal baths, in incense and tea.
In many areas magical effects are attributed to the plant. It is said that calamus
root keeps people young, strengthens their health and boosts their sexual lives.
A herbal bath with calamus is said to increase erotic desire. The original inhabitants
of North America chewed the roots to ward off exhaustion or took it as snuff in
a pulverized form (Ratsch, 1997). It is combined with Centella to stimulate sex
and promote wisdom. It is commonly considered a hallucinogenic herb, but a number
of people who tried the American strain (asarone-free) for this purpose did not
have good experiences. In some cases the person required medical attention after
ingestion. For pleasure, at least 30 cm of root has to be swallowed with a non-alcoholic
beverage: carbonated drink, milk, etc. Alcohol counteracts its effect.

282 Vacha

Figure 44 Acorus calamus A herb, B root pieces.

In Ayurveda the root is considered aromatic, bitter, hot, nauseating, anthelmintic,
sudoriﬁc, mildly laxative and it is said to help inﬂammation, gaseous distension, and
fevers. The details on these uses are as follows:

Vacha 283

As a mental tonic
For intellectuals and students it is often prescribed with Centella, Bacopa and Convolvulus
as a mental tonic. It increases memory and stimulates brain faculties. It helps unconsciousness, insanity, nervous breakdown, in physical debility and acts as a cerebral
stimulant. It may be used by mixing half a teaspoon each of vacha and ghee, with milk
for 2–3 months.

For pains and aches
Make a paste of the root by grinding it on a wet ﬂoor and apply it to the forehead.
When applied externally it stimulates blood ﬂow. It may be used on bruises and
rheumatism in the same way.

For migraines
Make a very ﬁne powder of vacha and long pepper and inhale a pinch of this mixture
through nose.

For expelling worms
Heat 500 mg of asafoetida and add to it 3 g vacha powder. Swallow it with water.
In acute cases use the mixture twice daily for 4–5 days.
An infusion of the root is sprinkled on the affected wound to drive away vermin.

For dry coughs
Briskly boil 25 g of coarse vacha powder in 250 ml of water. When warm, take 20 ml
of this decoction, 3– 4 times daily. It clears the throat and relieves dry throats and
coughs. It stimulates the mucous membrane and salivary glands, which results in
increased secretion.

For sinusitis
Sprinkle vacha powder on burning charcoal or a heater to produce smoke. Convert a
piece of thick paper into a funnel-shaped structure, 15 cm in diameter at the broad
end and about 1 cm at the tapered end (Fig. 45). Place the broader end slightly above
the smoke source in such a way that the funnel does not catch ﬁre but collects all the
fumes. The tapering end should be placed near the nostrils so that the smoke is
inhaled. Smoke is pungent but very effective. It clears the nose and through regular
treatment surgical operations for sinusitis may even be avoided.

For stomach troubles
For digestive problems such as ﬂatulence, dyspepsia and colic, boil 25 g of vacha in
500 ml of water and take 10–20 ml of decoction, depending on the severity of the
case. For infants, grind vacha into mother’s milk and give half a teaspoonful three
times a day.

284 Vacha

Figure 45 Method to inhale the fumes of the herb.

For spermatorrhoea
Pulverize 30 g Triphala, 10 g Piper cubeba, 10 g vacha and 5 g camphor. Take 2 g of
this powder with cold water, lime water or with milk in the morning on an empty
stomach, and two hours after meals in the evening. Continue until cured. This treatment makes the body physically strong, clears urine and helps digestion.

Contraindication
All items hot in nature, such as spicy, non-vegetarian food, alcohol, sex, etc. should be
avoided during treatment with calamus.

Ayurvedic preparation
Sarswat churn
Ingredients Pulverize equal quantities of Centella, Convolvulus and calamus. Moisten
this mixture with Centella juice or decoction and let the powder dry. Repeat this
process of moistening with juice three times. When fully dry use the powder.
Dose 3 g with milk for 3–4 months.
Use

As a general tonic, it increases mental and physical strength.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

Relaxant activity
A papaverine-like relaxant, depressant and anti-spasmodic activity has been seen in the
essential oil and in its isolated compounds asarone and β-asarone. It inhibited heart
rhythms in frogs and dogs and relaxed the tone of isolated intestine. The neuropharmacological action of the oil revealed its sedative and tranquillizing effect. It caused a
reduction in anxiety without dullness but with prolonged calming. It enhanced the
activity of pentabarbitol and hexobarbital. Asarone antagonized the hyperactive and
hallucinogenic effects of mescaline (personal communication). Both asarone and βasarone are psychoactive, but hallucinogenic in higher doses. The essential oil-free
alcohol extract had a sedative and analgesic property. The choloroform extract of the
root had a cannabis-like activity, and the intraperitoneal administration of this extract
brought about profound behavioural changes in monkeys (Dasgupta et al. 1977).
Khare and Sharma (1982) observed anti-epileptic activity in it. Keller et al. (1985)
noted that asarone had a spasmolytic activity against histamine. Aqueous alcohol
extract reduced the severity of maximum shock-induced seizures but did not exhibit
complete protection (Vohora et al. 1990). According to Martis et al. (1991) Acorus may
be of use for epilepsy. Prasad and Chakraborty (1992) found it to be less tranquillizing
but more hypotensive in nature. Zanoli et al. (1997) studied sedative and hypothermic
effects induced by β-asarone and concluded that this compound cannot be considered
a direct cannabinomimetic agent.
A polyherbal preparation containing ginseng, Polygala, Calamus and Macrohyporia
extensa was given to thymectomized mice after the operation. It signiﬁcantly ameliorated the learning and memory ability, which was impaired by thymecotomy. It acted
on the cognitive process of the central nervous system (Zhou et al. 1992, Zhang et al.
1994).

For mental retardation
A polyherbal formulation consisting of Centella asiatica, Calamus and Convolvulus was
given to mentally retarded children, in doses of 1,000 mg, 380 mg and 20 mg for one
year. The treated group showed an appreciable increase in verbal mental age within
seven and a half months, compared with the control. These herbs improved attention, activity levels and feed back, and controlled hyperactivity, aggressiveness, etc.
(Rajagopalan, 1995).

Anti-inﬂammatory effect
The total extract had anti-inﬂammatory activity in acute and chronic models.
It compared well with hydrocortisone and phenylbutazone (Sharma et al. 1989).
Anti-pyretic, analgesic and anti-inﬂammatory activities were also observed in this root
by Vohora et al. (1989) and by Siddiqui and Asif (1991).

286 Vacha

In gastropathy
Rafatullah et al. (1994) observed anti-secretagogue, anti-ulcer and cytoprotective properties in the ethanol extract of the herb. It had the ability to inhibit gastric secretion, to protect gastroduodenal mucosa against injuries caused by pyloric ligation,
indomethacin, reserpine, etc. It provided good protection against cytodestructive agents.

Anti-microbial properties
It exhibited anti-bacterial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other gram
negative organisms (Alankar Rao and Rajendra Prasad, 1981).
The alcohol extract exhibited potent anti-viral activity in vitro against HSV-1
and HSV-2 virus types at well below a cytotoxic concentration. Host cells were not
affected by the extract. The compound β-asarone, isolated from the extract, had a strong
inhibitory activity against the replication of both virus types. This study justiﬁed the
use of calamus as an anti-herpes agent (Badam, 1995).

In bronchial asthma
A preliminary report on the clinical trial has been given by Rajasekharan and Srivastava
(1977).

In heart diseases
When vacha was used for three months in ischaemic heart disease, Mamagain and
Singh (1994) observed an improvement in cases of chest pain, dyspnoea, reduced body
weight index, serum cholesterol, and in electrocardiograms.

As an anthelmintic
A polyherbal treatment, including 250 g Calamus powder, three times a day was
prescribed with Embelia ribes syrup (20 ml three times a day), Semecarpus oil (1 drop
twice daily for two days), followed by purgation using 250 mg Mallotus philippinensis
trichome powder twice daily, for two days, was highly effective against roundworm,
threadworm and hookworm. When vacha was used alone, it was only effective against
roundworm (Sharma et al. 1985).

Chemical studies
The root contains 1.5–3.5 per cent of yellow aromatic oil, mainly consisting of asarone
and β-asarone, eugenol, asaraldehyde, galangin, etc. The composition of the oil from
2n, 3n and 4n varieties differs and β-asarone content increases with ploidy. The oil
from the American 2n (diploid) race contains no asarone but in Indian varieties it is
very high (Evans, 1988). β-Asarone is related to myristicin, the active constituent of
nutmeg.

Toxicological studies
β-asarone is a hepatocarcinogen, mutagen and has a chromosome damaging property.
Indian calamus oil fed to rats induced duodenal tumours (Bruneton, 1995).

Ficus benghalensis L. (It is sometimes wrongly spelt as F. bengalensis)
F. religiosa L.
Family: Moraceae
Both these trees along with other Ficus spp. are sometimes used for the same purposes.

Ficus benghalensis
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a native of the Himalayan and south Indian mountainous regions, but has been
introduced as a sacred, shady tree in most parts of India, along village ponds or in
community centres. It covers a vast tract of land by spreading its branches and by its
prop roots, which hang from it and touch the soil to establish connections with it. As
the tree ages, more and more branches and hanging roots arise. Leaves (Fig. 46B) are
waxy, thick and leathery. Young buds are pink in colour. The fruit is red, enclosing
numerous small seeds.
It appears that earlier, in Indian villages, businessmen (called banya) used to display
their shop wares under the shade of this tree and at that time Englishmen named the
tree after them, the banyan tree.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In earlier Sanskrit literature, the tree has been considered on a par with soma (p. 262)
in its effect. All parts of the tree, bark, root, latex and fruits were used. Fruits and
young hanging roots were considered food for the elite to improve their memory
power. For this purpose, banyan bark was dried in the shade, pulverized and mixed
with double the quantity of sugar candy. Great importance was attached to the latex
(called milk). It was considered rejuvenating, a stimulant and nourishing. It was
collected from the tree by making a pit-like depression at the base of a large branch
after sunset. The mouth of the pit was closed with a lump of raw sugar. Before sunrise,
in the morning, the latex was collected in a vessel.
The other uses of the tree are as follows:

Pulverize dry tender shoots and hanging roots. Take a pinch of this powder at
regular intervals for spermatorrhoea.
Macerate opium and nutmeg in the latex of the banyan tree. Four to ﬁve drops
of this mixture on ﬂat sugar candy helps premature ejaculation and nocturnal
emission.
A decoction of banyan tree bark along with the other nourishing substances is said
to have good effect on retention, quality and quantity of semen.
Six grams of the pulverized powder of twigs dried in shade, mixed with an equal
quantity of sugar candy, when taken for seven days with 250–500 ml of milk ﬁrst
thing in the morning, thickens the semen and helps burning micturition.
The leaves also have a beneﬁcial effect on human regenerative powers.
Unripe fruits dried in the shade, ground well and drunk are said to augment the
urge for sex.

Vata Vriksh 291

Fry 600 mg of asafoetida in ghee and mix one teaspoon of honey and one of Ficus
benghalensis latex. Take this mixture twice daily for 40 days for impotence.

Contraindication
Do not use any sour or acidic things during treatment with this herb. Untoward
thoughts should not arise in the patient’s mind.

Ficus religiosa
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
The tree grows wild in the forests of central India and Bengal but has been introduced
in most parts of India as a sacred tree, where it is known as peepal. It is a spreading tree
with cordate, acuminate, glabrous leaves (Fig. 46A). The fruits are small and enclose
several seeds. The fruit is edible and is slightly sweet in taste.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
The decoction of the bark is considered cooling in effect (shitavirya, shit is cold
and virya effect) and is prescribed in cases of sexual inadequacies and nervous
debility which are supposed to have originated due to hotness in the body. The main
uses are:

As a Rasayana
On the ﬁrst day take 3 small peepal leaves and boil them in 125 ml milk and 125 ml
water. On the next day increase the number of leaves to six and prescribe them as they
were given on the ﬁrst day. Increase the dose by three leaves every day until a dose of
30 leaves per day is attained. After this, follow the treatment in a descending order
until a dose of three leaves a day is reached. This treatment is considered a Rasayana
in its effect and is said to bring about changes in the vital ﬂuid (dhatu parivartana) of
the body, which is useful in cases of paralysis, chronic coughs and other chronic
diseases.

For sexual inadequacies
a)

Boil 500 g of tender twigs in 4 litres of water until the quantity of water is
reduced to 500 ml. Cool and ﬁlter this decoction and add 2 kg sugar to make a
linctus. Take 30 g of this linctus daily along with 250 ml milk, 60 g butter and
sugar candy, according to taste.
b) Take one part of fresh green leaves and 8 parts of water. Crush the leaves and boil
them in water, until the water is reduced to one-fourth. Filter, concentrate the
decoction and add an equal quantity of sugar to it until a solid mass is obtained.
Make pills of 60 mg each. The dose is 2–3 pills twice daily.

292 Vata Vriksh

As a tonic for the nervous system
1
2

4

Dry fresh peepal bark in the shade, and pulverize it. Take this powder with milk
and sugar. This increases memory and strengthens the nervous system. It is a
brain tonic for weak memory and mental confusion.
In nervous debility, cook 120 g of young tender twigs, in half a litre of cow’s milk
three to four times. On cooling, strain the milk through cheesecloth. Add sugar
candy to it as per taste and drink.
For insanity, boil 2–3 tender leaves in about 100 ml milk until the milk condenses.
Add sugar according to taste.
For spasms and convulsion in children that arise due to involuntary muscle contraction, prepare a ﬁne powder of the tree’s hanging roots and mix it with an equal
quantity of saffron. Give 60–120 mg of this mixture at half-hour intervals.

For syphilis
Take the young bud or bark after boiling it in milk.

As a healing agent
The decoction of bark is an astringent and is quite effective for healing wounds, ulcers,
etc.

For psychoneurotic diseases
In cases of hysteria, emotional instability, intense craving, affections and wild emotions, etc., take 25 g of tender hanging roots, cut and pound them and add 12 g each
of Nardostachys jatamansi (N. grandiﬂora), nutmeg, and 1.5 g musk. Macerate the whole
mass in a blender and, when homogenous, make pills of 100 mg each. Prescribe one to
four pills, thrice daily for four months. Avoid tension and hot food.

Ayurvedic preparation
Peepalavleh
Method Take one part of panchang of peepal (ﬁve parts of tree, i.e. the root bark, leaves,
fruit, tender shoots and ﬁbrous hanging roots) and 16 parts of water. Macerate the
herb in water and boil until reduced to one-fourth. Filter this decoction and dry the
ﬁltrate further until a thick paste is formed. Make pills of 250 mg each from this
extract and wrap each pill in a piece of silver foil.
Dose 1–2 pills are to be taken with milk at night.
Use These pills are said to be effective in all cases of nervous debility, mental confusion
and mild insanity.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES OF F. benghalensis AND F. religiosa

Anti-diabetic effects
Neera Singh et al. (1992) observed that alcohol extract of F. benghalensis bark showed
signiﬁcant hypoglycaemic activity. It reduced levels of serum cholesterol and blood
urea. Cherian and Augusti (1993) noted anti-diabetic activity in glycoside leucopelargonidin isolated from F. benghalensis. It demonstrated hypoglycaemic, hypolipidemic
and serum insulin-raising levels in diabetic rats. It signiﬁcantly enhanced the faecal
secretion of sterols and bile acids. Vinod Kumar and Augusti (1993) showed that it
had an insulin sparing action. Augusti et al. (1994) conﬁrmed that the leucopelargonidin
derivative showed signiﬁcant hypoglycaemic and serum insulin-raising action in normal as well as in moderately diabetic dogs. Cherian and Augusti (1995) identiﬁed the
effective compound as dimethyl ether of leucopelargonidin (3-o-alpha-L-rhamnoside).
A low dose of insulin in combination with this compound maintained body weight,
controlled urine blood sugar and ameliorated serum cholesterol and triglycerides.

Anti-diarrhoeal effect
The extract of F. benghalensis hanging roots and F. racemosa bark had an inhibitory
effect against castor oil-induced diarrhoea. These extracts brought a reduction in
gastrointestinal motility (Mukherjee et al. 1998).

Antioxidant effect
Daniel et al. (1998) isolated quercetin and polyphenolic ﬂavonoids from the bark of F.
benghalensis and evaluated their antioxidant action in hyperlipidaemic rats. These compounds showed a signiﬁcant antioxidant effect and lowered serum lipids (cholesterol,
phospholipids, triacylglycerols and free fatty acids).

Antigastroduodenal ulcer effects
A water decoction of F. religiosa bark protected the animals against induced gastric
and duodenal ulcers (Bipul De, 1997).

Hypocholesterolaemic effect
Shukla et al. (1995) fed the water extract of F. benghalensis bark with cholesterol to
rabbits. The bark extract not only prevented the elevation of serum cholesterol but
brought its level down. There was an improvement in other parameters of lipid
proﬁles. Daniel et al. (1998) conﬁrmed this activity.

For leucorrhoea
Three grams of F. benghalensis bark, when administered ﬁve times a day for 30 days
gave relief to patients with leucorrhoea (Sannd and Krishan Kumari, 1992).

294 Vata Vriksh

Anti-tumour activity
The fruit extracts of F. religiosa and F. benghalensis exhibited anti-tumour and antibacterial activity (Mousa, 1994).

Toxicological studies
The leucopelargonidin derivatives did not show any toxic effects when administered
for one month and and were not lethal, even at the high dose of 1.8 g/kg (Augusti et
al. 1994).

Vatsnabh 295

54 Vatsnabh

Aconitum spp.
Family: Ranunculaceae
THE PLANTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION
The plants, which yield aconite (vatsnabh of Ayurveda) grow in the alpine Himalayas.
Earlier botanists identiﬁed these as Aconitum napellus L., but this identiﬁcation was
erroneous. The Indian aconites, which can be the source of vatsnabh, have been identiﬁed by Puri (1974a). The names of these, along with their natural distribution in
India, are as follows: Aconitum deinorrhizum Stapf South Kashmir, A. falconeri Stapf
Garhwal, A. balfourii Stapf Grahwal to Nepal, A. ferox Wall. ex Seringe, A. spicatum
Stapf, and A. laciniatum Stapf, in Singalila Range, Darjeeling.
These plants are herbs, usually about 1 metre tall, but some plants of A. spicatum
(Fig. 47A) may grow taller. The ﬂowers are generally blue with a characteristic hood
(Fig. 47B) and nectaries (Fig. 47C). The roots of these plants are characteristic (Fig. 47D)
in that the mother tuber gives rise to the plant as well as to a daughter tuber (Fig.
47E). As the plant grows, the mother tuber shrivels due to nutrient depletion and the
daughter tuber develops with an apical bud at the top. Puri (1975) provides a detailed
botanical description of Indian aconites.
Aconite is one of the oldest herbs known to Indian physicians. It is a component
of many Chinese preparations and in Tibet it is known as ‘king of medicine’ (Puri,
1974b). The poisonous nature of aconite is well known to Indians where the plant grows
and they call it vish or bikh, which means poison. Earlier it was used as an arrow poison.
In the nineteenth century a root known as Jadwar Khatai, considered an antidote to
poisons and sold at the price of gold, was much in demand. The British East India
Company became interested in it as the source of a commercial commodity. On the
basis of organoleptic characteristics it looked like some aconites, so Stapf was deputed
by the East India Company to investigate the source of this precious herb, resulting in
a monograph on Indian aconites (Stapf, 1905).
The dry roots of vatsnabh are brownish and horn-like (Fig. 47F), 6–12 cm long and
2–4 cm broad. The internal colour of the tuber may be off-white to brown to black.
The fracture is horny and, on breaking the tuber, star-like cambium is visible. The
root is starchy, has no smell but causes a tingling sensation when applied to the tip of
the tongue. (Caution: it is very poisonous.) Since black aconite fetches a higher price,
sometimes the off-white or brown aconite roots are boiled in ferrous sulphate dissolved

296 Vatsnabh

in cow’s urine to give the root a black colour (Fig. 47G). Pharmacognostic details on
these aconites are described by Mehra and Puri (1970).
Aconite is one of the major nine poisons known in Ayurveda. For medicinal purposes
it is used after mitigation by breaking the root into pea-sized pieces. These pieces are
immersed in a pot containing cow’s urine and the pot is kept in sunlight throughout

Vatsnabh 297
the day. Next day the old urine is discarded and replaced with fresh. This process is
repeated three times and the root pieces are dried for future use. Sometimes the roots
are boiled in cow’s urine, instead of giving the above treatment.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
According to Ayurveda, vatasnabh after mitigation is hot and bitter but, if used in a
proper way, it is a good Rasayana with anti-tridosha effects, mainly against vata and
kapha. It increases internal ﬁre (agni) within the body. It is an analgesic, anti-pyretic,
cardiotonic and an anti-inﬂammatory agent. Earlier it was recommended in acute
stages of venereal diseases, but now it is only used to a limited extent due to the lack
of safety in therapeutic doses. As given by Puri (1974b) the various uses of mitigated
aconites, at a dose of 7.5–15 mg, are as follows:

Anti-pyretic, anti-periodic and diaphoretic
It is used in various types of fevers.

For respiratory problems
Mainly used for asthma, where it provides good relief.

As a cardiotonic
For blood pressure problems, it is used as an hypotensive agent. It is a heart and nerve
sedative and prevents heart palpitations. After mitigation in the Ayurvedic way, the
roots lose their depressant action on the heart and develop a stimulating effect.

As a mental and physical tonic
It is prescribed as an aphrodisiac, particularly for involuntary urination and seminal
ejaculation.

As an anodyne
It is used for neuralgia, trifacial neuralgia and rheumatism. It has a signiﬁcant antiinﬂammatory activity. In western pharmacopoeias, a preparation containing aconite,
belladonna and chloroform was earlier very popular and applied externally to relieve pain.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

General studies
Singh et al. (1985) studied the pharmacology of mitigated aconite for cardiotonic,
analgesic, anti-pyretic and anti-inﬂammatory activity. The aconite showed all these
activities and was not cardiotoxic. In another study Murayama et al. (1991) observed

298 Vatsnabh
that processed aconite contained pyro-type alkaloids. These alkaloids had an analgesic
and anti-inﬂammatory effect but were low in toxicity.

Cardiotonic effects
According to Dong and Chen (1995) the alkaloid showed therapeutic and prophylactic
effects on different models of experimental arrhythmia without causing a marked
effect on myocardial contractility.

Anti-cancerous property
The aconite extract increased the secretion of interlukin-1β tumour necrosis factor α
and interleukin-6 in human mononuclear cells (Chang et al. 1994).

Chemical studies
The roots may contain 0.4–1.85 per cent of diterpenoid alkaloids, which resemble
aconitine isolated from A. napellus. Some of the well known alkaloids from Indian
aconites are bikhaconitine, pseudaconitine, aconitine, bishatisine and bishaconitine.
Out of these pseudaconitine is the most toxic, bikhaconitine and indaconitine are
more active than aconitine (Mehra and Puri, 1970).

Toxicological studies
POISONOUS and if used in excess of the prescribed dose it stops the heart.

Vibhitaki 299

55 Vibhitaki

Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb.
Syn. T. belerica Roxb.
Family: Combretaceae
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a deciduous tree commonly known by the name bahera. It may grow up to 30 m
in height. It grows throughout India except on very dry and marshy land. The leaves
(Fig. 48A) are elliptic or broadly elliptic, obovate up to 7.5 cm long, crowded towards
the end of the branches. Flowers are light greenish yellow, 1.25 cm across and have an
offensive odour. The fruit (Fig. 48B) is a drupe, grey to light violet and 2–5 cm long.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurveda, negative virtues are attributed to this tree, and the fruit is rarely used
alone. In folklore, the unripe fruit is considered a laxative and the mature fruit an
astringent. The fruit powder (2–10 g) is used for coughs, throat problems, fevers,
and in gastroenteritis. The seed kernel is said to have analgesic, anti-inﬂammatory,
aphrodisiac and narcotic effect. The seed oil is applied as a hair tonic. It is purgative,
like castor oil. The fruit of this tree is one of the three ingredients of a very common
Ayurvedic preparation Triphala.
THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES
An astringent, tonic, laxative and antipyretic effect have been seen in vibhitaki by Nandi
et al. (1975), which may be of use for dropsy and leprosy. The other studies are as follows:

Anti-microbial properties
Four compounds isolated from the fruit exhibited anti HIV-1 activity, anti-malarial
activity against Plasmodium falciparum, anti-fungal activity against Penicillium expansum
and Candida albicans in vitro (Raghvan et al. 1997).

300 Vibhitaki

Figure 48 Terminalia bellirica A twig, B fruit.

Anti-diabetic activity
When Siddiqui (1961) injected ethanol extract, equivalent to one gram of dry fruit,
intraperitonially into rabbits, it reduced blood sugar levels.

Hepatoprotective activity
Siddiqui (1963) found that it stimulated bile secretion. The fruit exhibited a signiﬁcant
hepatoprotective effect in a dose-dependent manner. A fraction of the fruit extract was

Vibhitaki 301
tried on experimentally-induced hepatic injury in rats. The results were encouraging;
it had both prophylactic and curative properties (Anand et al. 1994).

Anti-tussive and anti-asthmatic activity
The fruit exhibited bronchodilator, antispasmodic and anti-asthmatic effects. Trivedi
et al. (1982) treated 93 cases of asthma using this fruit, 22 patients showed complete
relief, in 22 cases there was a signiﬁcant relief and in 35 cases there was moderate
relief. It was effective in tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, with less relapse (Abhimanyu
Kumar et al. 1994).

For myocardial necrosis
Tariq et al. (1977) used it along with amalaki.

Anti-mutagenic effect
The polyphenols isolated from the fruit showed this effect on Salmonella tymphimurium
(Padam et al. 1966).

Anti-uraemic activity
Yokozawa et al. (1995) conﬁrmed that tannins in the fruit have a uraemic decreasing
effect.

Chemical studies
The fruit contains 21.4 per cent of both condensed and hydrolyzable tannins. Of these
the important ones are gallic acid, ellagic acid and epigalates. In addition to these,
saponins, nitrogenous crystalline principle phyllembin and a cardiac glycoside have
also been isolated (Thakur et al. 1989).

Toxicological studies
It is very safe. No toxicity was seen, even up to a dose of 3.3 g/kg (Anand et al. 1994).

Vidari Kand

303

56 Vidari Kand

Pueraria tuberosa (Roxb. Ex Willd.) DC
Family: Fabaceae (Leguminose )
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It is a liana (Fig. 49A), found in sub-arid zones of India. The main tuber is like a big
turnip and, in the soil, may be followed by smaller and smaller tubers in a chain. The
tuber is brownish from the outside and dirty-white to pale yellow inside, which on
drying may be thick on the outside, but with a ﬂake-like structure inside or may be
in the form of a barrel shape, in pieces 25–50 cm long and 25 cm thick. These dry
papery wafers (Fig. 49B) have a liquorice-like taste. In south India, tubers of other plants,
such as Ipomoea digitata, pith of Cycas and sometimes palms are considered vidar kand.
In many instances in Ayurvedic literature, vidari kand has been identiﬁed as I. digitata.

USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
As per Ayurveda, it is a good nutrient, energizer, boosts vital energy and is an
aphrodisiac. It is sweet in ras, a galactagogue, spermatogenic, cooling, greasy, diuretic
and effective against all the three kaphas, calming burning sensations in the body. It is
advisable to use it in cold areas or in cold weather. It is mainly used in the form of a
ﬁne powder for the following purposes;

As a galactagogue
For a lack of milk after childbirth, 5 g of powder is given to mothers in cow’s milk.

As an anabolic agent
A weak child is given 2 g of powder with milk for digestion. For additional beneﬁts,
2 g of peepali powder may be given along with it.

For digestive problems
Six grams of powder with ghee and sugar is given twice daily for enlargement of the
liver and spleen.

304 Vidari Kand

Figure 49 Pueraria tuberosa A twig, B pieces of tuber.

Vidari Kand

305

For excessive menstruation
Six grams of powder is used twice daily with honey.

For sexual debility
Fry crushed wheat or barley in ghee and add milk, honey, sugar and vidari powder to it.

For spermatorrhoea
1 Take pulverized vidari dried in its own juice and add almond, quince seed, clove,
cardamom, nutmeg, satavari, kawanch and sugar. Take 6 g of this powder with milk.
2 Take juice of fresh root with cumin and sugar.

In Chinese traditional medicine
In the book written by Li Shih Chen in 1578, Pueraria lobata root (kudzu or ko for) has
been mentioned for relieving thirst, for febrile conditions, as an anti-emetic, antitoxic, for colds, snake bites and to counter the effect of excessive alcohol. It is said
to help hypertension, stiffness of the neck, lack of perspiration, migraines, angina
pectoris, hypoglycaemia and arterial diseases. For treating sudden deafness, alcohol
extract of the tuber is prescribed, whilst for neck stiffness and hypertension a decoction is used.
Earlier P. thomsonii was used in China but P. lobata has been found to be richer in
the active constituents, isoﬂavones. The tubers of these two species can be easily
differentiated by their internal characters. Whereas the root of P. thomsonii is white
due to the starch, P. lobata is yellow due to an excess of ﬁbres. (It appears that tubers
of P. thomsonii resemble that of P. tuberosa.)

Ayurvedic preparations
Maharasayana yoga
Method Pulverized vidari tuber is saturated with the fresh juice of vidari and dried.
This process is repeated 21 times and the powder is dried completely. If the fresh juice
is not readily available, a decoction can be prepared by boiling coarse vidari powder in
eight times as much water until water is reduced to one-fourth. After ﬁltration, use
this decoction in place of the juice.
Dose 5–10 g.
Use An immunostimulant which increases the strength, power and sexual capacity in
males.

THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL
STUDIES

As an anti-inﬂammatory agent
The peeled root, bruised into a cataplasm, reduced swelling. It was crushed
and rubbed on the body for fevers and rheumatism. Nikam et al. (1977) isolated a
steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent from the root. It was fully reversible, indicating that steroids act as an anti-depolarizing agent. Lee et al. (1994) studied the antiinﬂammatory activity of ﬂavonoids daidzein and puerarin. Both showed signiﬁcant
anti-inﬂammatory activity. Cho and Kim (1985) studied the product Galgumn-tang for
anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic action. This product mainly consisted of P. thunbergiana
and showed remarkable inhibition of inﬂammation.

For nervous diseases
Xiuxian and Xuiquin (1979) found that Radix puerarie was effective in 83 per cent of
migraine cases. Shen et al. (1996) reported that the ﬂavones from the root are antagonists or weak partial agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor.

For heart problems
Fan et al. (1985) carried out a pharmacological study on radix puerariae for acute
regional myocardial ischaemia. It decreased the mean arterial pressure without decreasing the collateral coronary blood ﬂow. Fang (1980) found that 100 mg of total
isoﬂavones cured 90 per cent of hypertensive cases, 80 per cent of angina pectoris
cases and 92 per cent of migraine cases. In the treatment of hypertension, total
isoﬂavins injected into the carotid artery were capable of dilating the cerebral blood
ﬂow. It may be due to improved cerebral circulation that patients suffering hypertension, from migraines, and sudden deafness received relief. These compounds lowered
catecholamine levels, decreased the oxygen supply and depressed lactic acid production by the oxygen-deﬁcient heart muscles in angina pectoris. The compounds were
not effective orally as they were destroyed in the body.

As an anti-spasmodic
Shibata et al. (1959) studied ﬂavonoids and anthraquinones from P. hirsuata syn.
P. lobata. They showed anti-spasmodic properties.

For gynaecological problems
It had emmenagogue, signiﬁcant oestrogenic and progesteronogenic activities with no
toxicity. The alcoholic extract was highly effective in dysmenorrhoea, dysfunctional
uterine bleeding and in menopausal syndrome. Patients resistant to routine hormonal
therapy responded remarkably to this treatment (Chandhoke et al. p.c.). Shukla et al.
(1996) found that butanol extract had an oestrogenic mode of action. It increased
glycogen content, protein concentration and total cholesterol in the reproductive organs
of ovariectomized rats.

Vidari Kand

307

Khurana et al. (1996) studied the effect of a herbal galactagogue containing Leptadenia,
fennel, Glycyrrhiza, Pueraria, Asparagus and cumin on the milk yield of lactating
buffaloes. The preparation resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in milk yield. The result
was evident within seven days of treatment and was sustained for 35 days.

In alcoholism (antidipsotropic agent)
Keung and Vallee (1993) observed that the active constituents of the root, daidzin and
daidzein, suppressed free-choice alcohol intake by Syrian golden hamsters. Overstreet
et al. (1993) carried out further research. Keung et al. (1996) compared the effect of
pure daidzin with that of crude daidzin contained in the methanol extract of the root,
and concluded that this effect is not due to daidzin alone, but to the joint action of
both isoﬂavone constituents daidzin and daidzein (Keung and Vallee, 1998).

Antioxidant effect
Sato et al. (1992) noted the antioxidant action of Pueraria isoﬂavonoids. These were
able to scavenge free radicals involved in lipid peroxidation initiation. Speroni et al.
(1996) conﬁrmed this antioxidant effect.

Hepatoprotective effect
Sohn et al. (1985) noted that in the case of cadmium toxicity P. thunbergiana butanol
extract had a diuretic and antidotal effect. Shukla et al. (1996) studied the protective
action of butanol extract of the root on carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity in
rats. Treatment with P. tuberosa, seven days prior to administration of carbon tetrachloride protected rats against liver damage. Araro (1998) noted the preventive effects
of nine saponins, isolated from the root, on the liver in in vitro immunological liver
injury in primary cultured rat hepatocytes.

Chemical studies
Various isoﬂavones like puerarin, daidzein and daidzin have been reported.

Toxicological studies
Shukla (1995) studied in detail, the toxicity of the butanol extract of this tuber. Using
this treatment the concentration of serum GPT (glutamic purvic transaminase) and
GOT (glutamino oxaloacetic transaminase or aspartate transminase) were signiﬁcantly higher. Signiﬁcant changes were observed in the adrenal glands but there were
no histopathological or functional effects.

Vidhara

309

57 Vidhara

Argyreia speciosa Sweet
Syn: A. nervosa (Bulm f.) Bojes
Family: Convolvulaceae
In western countries, it is known as Baby Rosewood or Hawaiian Baby Rosewood.
THE PLANT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
It mainly grows in deciduous forests but can be cultivated in warm climates. It is
a liana with big cordate leaves (Fig. 50A) and a twining stem, with greenish violetwhite ﬂowers. The fruit is globular, enclosing three seeds. Each seed (Fig. 50B) is
pyramidal in shape with a broad hilum.
In India, the genuine seeds are known as bidhara beej asli and are hard to obtain.
These are very often substituted for similar types of seed of other members of
Convolvulaceae. The plant is also known as samunderphul.
USES IN FOLKLORE AND AYURVEDA
In Ayurvedic formulations, the genuine seed is rarely used and are often substituted by
the stem pieces of this plant, called vidhara root. It is considered an alterative, nervine
tonic, aphrodisiac and is an important constituent of many commercial aphrodisiac
preparations sold in India.
One of these preparations, Ashwagandhadi Churn (p. 49), is made by pulverizing
equal quantities of vidhara stem with ashwagandha. Sometimes an equal quantity of
Hygrophila spinosa seed powder is also added to it. Another product is prepared by
soaking the pulverized root of Argyreia in Asparagus juice. After drying, when given in
a dose of 3–6 g with ghee, for a month, it is said to improve intellect, strengthens the
body and keeps old age away.
A psychedelic product, Utopian Bliss Balls is prepared by taking 5 Argyreia seed, 1
pinch of ginseng, 1 pinch of gotu kola and 1 teaspoon bee pollen. The mixture is
stuffed into date palm pulp (Ratsch, 1997).
The seed is mainly used for the extraction of lysergic acid compounds, d lysergic
acid amide and d isolysergic acid amide, both of which are closely related to LSD
(d-lysergic acid diethylamide) obtained from ergot, by ﬁrst extracting the seed with

310 Vidhara

petroleum ether and then with alcohol. A paste of 8–10 seeds, after removal of
seed coat, is said to have a good hallucinogenic effect. The results are more tranquil
than those induced by LSD. In some people it has a depressant effect whilst in others
it acts as an invigorating agent (from the internet, on the basis of some people’s
experience).

Chemical studies
It contains ergoline-type alkaloids, some of which are hallucinogenic. A seed contains
3 mg of ergoline and ergometrine (Chao and Dermarderosian, 1973, Agarwal and
Rastogi (1974), Wealth of India, 1985).

312 Some Rasayana formulations

58 Some Rasayana formulations

Since ancient times, classical Ayurvedic texts have mentioned Rasayana formulations.
These have been manufactured all over the Indian subcontinent for several centuries
by learned vaidyas (physicians). The number of these formulations is so large that it is
not possible to list all of them. In recent times, many Ayurvedic physicians, using
their experience and keeping the need of the society in view, have developed more
Rasayana products which are sold under trade names. Today, Ayurvedic pharmacies
manufacture both classical preparations and trade name preparations. A selection of
these products is given here. The ﬁrst part consists of classical formulations, which are
manufactured under their Ayurvedic name, and the second part lists preparations
where trade names are used.
CLASSICAL FORMULATIONS
These have been selected from the Ayurvedic literature on the basis of their uniqueness and popularity. In each formulation, the name of the ingredients and parts used
have been identiﬁed from the Sanskrit name and are listed in a table. The quantity of
each and the dose of the products have been converted into grams (approximately). On
the basis of information in the Sanskrit texts, a summary of the method of preparation
and uses of each product is given. As will be seen from these tables, quite a number
of minerals/gems/poisonous substances are included in these formulations. This was
probably done to potentiate the slow action of the herbs on the human system, or to
provide rare minerals to the body, or may have been a result of the feudal system of
society in mediaeval India, which had become so sophisticated that complex compounds with precious and rare ingredients were the need of the hour. Most of these
compounds contained ambergris, saffron and musk, which are hard to ﬁnd even now.
Stress was laid on incorporation of inorganic compounds in organic forms. These compounds, in formulations, are actually complex organo-metallic compounds prepared by
various tedious processes of treating minerals, etc. with many herbs, and subjecting
them to high temperatures, so that they turn ash-like (bhasama) and become partly
soluble in water for bioavailablity to the human system. In earlier English translations,
the term calcination was used for this process of treating minerals, etc., but, as later
discovered, it is not a simple process of heating raw materials but consists of subjecting them to various herbal treatments so the term, processed has been used in the
present text. Special mention may be made of red sulphide of mercury, which is used
extensively in Rasayana preparations. In Ayurveda there are two different processes for

its manufacture. In one of the products, called Makardhawaj, gold is used as a catalyst,
while the other product, Ras Sindur, is manufactured without gold.

Method Blanch amalaki fruit with the steam generated from milk (use milk instead
of water). When soft, remove the nut from the pulp, dry and pulverize it. Mix with
amalaki powder, juice of 1,000 amalaki fruits prepared separately and dry. When the
whole mass dries, weigh it, add to it one-eighth of its weight of the pulverized herbs
mentioned above, taking each herb in equal quantity. Add to this powder of mixture
of herbs and amalaki, four litres of Sida spinosa juice and dry the whole mass again in
the shade. Pulverize this mixture once again, and add two parts of honey and one part
of ghee until a thick paste is formed. Pour the paste in a container, seal, and subject it
to mild heat in such a way that the heat is uniform all over. Let it remain undisturbed
for two weeks, and note the weight of the product obtained. Take equal quantities of
all inorganic compounds (Bhasamas) given in the formulations to form one-eighth of
the total weight of the amalaki preparation obtained above. Mix the two to form a
homogenous paste for the pills.
Use This Rasayana is mainly used for Kuti Parveshika (indoor Rasayana treatment) for
rejuvenation of the whole body under the guidance of a health provider, who monitors
the condition of the patient, determines the dose and duration.
