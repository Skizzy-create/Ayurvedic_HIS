FOREWORD
Most of the diseases arise due to improper food habits
and faulty life style besides hereditary and other reasons.
Mankind has constantly grappled with ill health and tried to
achieve health & happiness. These efforts are on from time
im mem orial. These endeavors have thrown up various
systems of medicine. Ayurveda is one such system evolved
in India, which tries to bring harmony between man & nature
by using holistic methods of diagnosis, prevention and
treatment. Like all other Indian contributions it is intertwined
with Indian philosophy, yoga and science.
The modem since is successful in inventing medicines for
many diseases. But complete health is still a mirage for the
mankind. Strong synthetic drugs are creating innumerable
side effects known & unknown sometim es making the
treatm ent m ore dangerous than the disease itself. As a
contrast Ayurveda preaches gentle way of treatment mainly
based on herbs and diet. Many of most effected drugs are
simple, easily available and can be prepared at home.
This Booklet offers some simple recipes prepared from
the materials available in and around the kitchen, For simple
problems like cough, cold, indigestion etc, these preparations
are very effective. For chronic problems like diabetes, joint
pain, skin diseases these remedies may be used even along
with other medication.
I hope that this booklet will be beneficial to the readers.
